## Implementation Guidelines

When adding interactive elements to chapters:

1. **Distribution:** Aim for 3-5 interactive elements per chapter
2. **Variety:** Include at least one element from each major category
3. **Placement:** Position elements after related content, not at points that interrupt key explanations
4. **Relevance:** Ensure each element directly relates to the surrounding content
5. **Value:** Each interaction should provide genuine insight, not just activity for its own sake
6. **Accessibility:** Ensure activities are accessible to readers in different circumstances
7. **Adaptability:** Provide alternatives for exercises that require specific resources

## Design Notes

When implementing these elements visually:
- Use consistent iconography for each type of element
- Apply subtle background colors to distinguish interactive sections
- Ensure adequate spacing before and after interactive elements
- Consider adding page border treatments for workbook sections
- Make interactive sections visually distinct but harmonious with overall design
