# Build Script Fix - Devlog

## 2025-03-16 - Initial Investigation

### Problem Identification
- Build process is failing with error: `Error: Cannot find module '/opt/buildhome/repo/work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js'`
- The prebuild script in package.json is trying to run a script that doesn't exist at the expected location

### Root Cause Analysis
- In package.json, the prebuild script is trying to run a script at `work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js`
- This directory structure doesn't exist at the root level
- The actual script exists at `.AI-Setup/work_efforts/completed/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js`

### Solution Implementation
1. Created the missing directory structure at the root level
   ```bash
   mkdir -p work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements
   ```

2. Copied the image optimization script to the correct location
   ```bash
   cp .AI-Setup/work_efforts/completed/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/
   ```

3. Created a work effort (14_build_script_fix) to document this fix

### Testing
- Ran `npm run build` to test if the fix resolved the issue
- Build completed successfully without the previous error
- While there were some warnings about unused CSS selectors, these are unrelated to our fix

### Conclusion
- The root cause was a mismatch between the path referenced in package.json and the actual location of the image optimization script
- Our solution successfully fixed the build process by creating the directory structure that package.json expected
- For long-term maintainability, we've documented alternative approaches that could be implemented in the future
