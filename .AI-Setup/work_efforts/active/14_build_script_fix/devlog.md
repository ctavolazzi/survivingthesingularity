# Build Script Fix - Devlog

## 2025-03-16 - Initial Investigation

### Problem Identification
- Build process is failing with error: `Error: Cannot find module '/opt/buildhome/repo/work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js'`
- The prebuild script in package.json is trying to run a script that doesn't exist at the expected location

### Root Cause Analysis
- In package.json, the prebuild script is trying to run a script at `work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js`
- This directory structure doesn't exist at the root level
- The actual script exists at `.AI-Setup/work_efforts/completed/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js`

### Solution Implementation
1. Created the missing directory structure at the root level
   ```bash
   mkdir -p work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements
   ```

2. Copied the image optimization script to the correct location
   ```bash
   cp .AI-Setup/work_efforts/completed/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/
   ```

3. Created a work effort (14_build_script_fix) to document this fix

### Next Steps
- Test the build process to ensure it works correctly
- Consider updating the package.json script to use a more maintainable approach in the future
