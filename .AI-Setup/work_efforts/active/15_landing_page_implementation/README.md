# Work Effort: NoavaSystem Landing Page Implementation

## 🚩 Objectives
- Create a clean, no-friction landing page for "Surviving the Singularity: A Practical Work Effort System"
- Implement a simple download + pay-what-you-want payment model
- Ensure the page clearly communicates it's part of the NoavaSystem on GitHub
- Design a page that's likely to gain traction in AI-adjacent productivity circles

## 🛠 Tasks
- [ ] Design the landing page layout with clean, minimal UI
- [ ] Create compelling copy for the headline, subheading, and supporting text
- [ ] Implement download functionality
- [ ] Integrate pay-what-you-want payment options (Gumroad, Ko-Fi, Buy Me a Coffee, or self-hosted)
- [ ] Add relevant links to Twitter/X (@thecoffeejesus), Teleport Massive HQ, and YouTube
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Optimize page load speed
- [ ] Set up analytics to track page visits and conversions

## 📝 Notes
- The page needs to be clean and frictionless to maximize downloads
- Pay-what-you-want model keeps it accessible while allowing supporters to contribute
