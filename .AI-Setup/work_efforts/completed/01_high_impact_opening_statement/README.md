# Work Effort: High-Impact Opening Statement

## Objective
Replace the generic opening statement with a high-impact, emotionally engaging statement that creates urgency and immediately connects with the user's personal interests.

## Current State
The page currently opens with "Your Journey Begins Here" which is generic and doesn't create urgency or excitement.

## Implemented Changes
1. Replaced the hero title with a more provocative statement: "AI is already reshaping careers. Will yours survive the next 5 years?"
2. Updated the hero description to: "Learn the critical skills and mindsets that will keep you relevant in the AI revolution. Our resources help you prepare for what's coming."

## Rationale
This immediately personalizes the stakes and creates emotional investment. It speaks to professional survival - something everyone cares about right now, not in some distant future. The question format also engages the user's mind directly and prompts self-reflection.

The updated description offers hope and a solution to balance the provocative question, creating both tension and release, which is psychologically compelling, while avoiding unverified claims about our impact.

## Implementation Details
- Modified the hero-title and hero-description in src/routes/start-here/+page.svelte
- Maintained the existing styling for consistency
- The combination of concern (in the title) and solution (in the description) creates a powerful psychological hook

## Success Metrics
- Increased time spent on page
- Higher click-through rate to subsequent sections
- Improved conversion on newsletter signups
