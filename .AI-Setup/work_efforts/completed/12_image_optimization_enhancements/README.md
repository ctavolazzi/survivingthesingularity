# Image Optimization Enhancements

## üö© Objectives
- Automate WebP conversion in the build pipeline
- Implement lazy loading for all non-critical images
- Add responsive image sizing with srcset for key images
- Further improve site performance and user experience

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Install necessary packages for automated image optimization
- [x] Configure Vite to process images during build
- [x] Audit the codebase for images missing lazy loading
- [x] Add loading="lazy" attribute to appropriate images
- [x] Identify key images that would benefit from responsive sizes
- [x] Implement srcset and sizes attributes for responsive images
- [x] Test site performance before and after enhancements

## üìù Notes
This work effort builds on the previous WebP conversion work by automating the process and adding additional performance optimizations:

1. **Automated WebP Conversion**: We've added vite-imagetools and sharp for automated image processing during build, along with a custom image build hook
2. **Lazy Loading**: We've systematically added loading="lazy" to 28 images across the codebase while smartly skipping critical above-the-fold images
3. **Responsive Images**: We've implemented a ResponsiveImage component that generates srcset and sizes attributes for optimized delivery on different screen sizes

The optimizations should yield significant performance improvements:
- Reduced initial page load time (only critical images load immediately)
- Lower bandwidth usage (especially on mobile devices)
- Better user experience with faster rendering
- Maintained visual quality using modern image formats

## üêû Issues Encountered
- Initial typing issues with the ResponsiveImage component (resolved with proper TypeScript type definitions)
- Compatibility issues with the latest glob package (resolved by using version 10)
- Potential duplicate image generation with both manual conversion and automated tools (solution: use a unified approach for new images)
- Corrupted default-avatar.jpg file causing build failures (resolved by removing the invalid image and adding error handling)

## ‚úÖ Outcomes & Results
- Created a reusable ResponsiveImage component to simplify future image optimizations
- Added lazy loading to 28 images across the site, reducing initial load time
- Implemented srcset and sizes attributes for key images like the book cover
- Setup automated build tools for ongoing image optimization
- Added a dedicated npm script for image optimization (npm run optimize-images)
- Enhanced error handling in the image build hook to gracefully skip problematic images instead of failing the entire build
- Fixed deployment error by removing corrupted default-avatar.jpg file

## üìÖ Timeline & Progress

- **Completed**: 2024-03-09
- **Updated**: 2024-03-09 (Build error fix)
