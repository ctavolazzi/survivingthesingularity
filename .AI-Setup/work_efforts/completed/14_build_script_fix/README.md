# Build Script Fix - Work Effort 14

## Problem
The build process is failing because it's trying to run a script at `work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js` which doesn't exist at the root level. The actual script is located at `.AI-Setup/work_efforts/completed/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js`.

## Solution
1. Create the necessary directory structure at the root level: `work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/`
2. Copy the image optimization script from `.AI-Setup/work_efforts/completed/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js` to `work_efforts/12_image_optimization_enhancements/image_build_hook.js`

This ensures the prebuild script defined in `package.json` can find and run the image optimization script.

## Implementation
- Created the missing directory structure
- Copied the image optimization script to the correct location

## Future Considerations
For a more maintainable solution in the future, consider one of these options:
1. Update the package.json script to point to the correct location in the .AI-Setup directory
2. Create a symlink from the root work_efforts to the .AI-Setup work_efforts
3. Move all build-related scripts to a dedicated build directory that's not tied to the work effort structure

## Status
- [x] Created directory structure
- [x] Copied image build hook script
- [x] Tested build process - Successfully completed
