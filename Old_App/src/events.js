Quantum computers leverage quantum bits or qubits to perform computations in ways that classical computers cannot, enabling them to solve complex problems exponentially faster in certain domains. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, drug discovery, and materials science, offering solutions to problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computers. Ongoing research and development in quantum computing aim to harness the power of quantum mechanics to unlock new frontiers in computation and technology.",
