            "The White House is rejecting a long-shot effort from House Republicans to get President Joe Biden to testify before lawmakers in the GOP\u2019s stalled impeachment inquiry",
            "WASHINGTON -- The White House on Monday rejected a long-shot effort from House Republicans to get President Joe Biden to testify before lawmakers in the GOP's stalled impeachment inquiry.",
            "In a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, the White House dismissed the invitation sent to Biden last month, calling it a \u201cpartisan charade\u201d in an impeachment probe that has unearthed no evidence implicating the president in any wrongdoing while in public office. House Republicans had been seeking information related to the Biden family's business dealings in what the GOP characterized as an alleged influence-peddling scheme.",
            "\u201cYour Committee\u2019s purported \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019 has succeeded only in turning up abundant evidence that, in fact, the President has done nothing wrong,\u201d Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, wrote in the letter sent to Comer on Monday.",
            "Sauber added, \u201cYour insistence on peddling these false and unsupported allegations despite ample evidence to the contrary makes one thing about your investigation abundantly clear: The facts do not matter to you.\u201d",
            "Sauber himself is leaving the White House early next month, another sign from the administration's perspective that the House Republicans' push to impeach Biden is largely over. The lawyer was brought on in 2022 to oversee the White House's response to congressional investigations as Democrats braced to lose their majorities on Capitol Hill later that November.",
            "To replace Sauber, the White House is elevating his deputy, Rachel Cotton. Sauber is returning to the private sector.",
            "In his request to the White House, Comer had asked Biden to \u201cexplain, under oath,\u201d what involvement he had in the Biden family businesses.",
            "The committee has asserted for the past year that the Bidens traded on the family name, by trying to link a handful of phone calls or dinner meetings between Joe Biden, when he was vice president or out of office, and Hunter Biden and his business associates.",
            "But despite dedicating countless resources and interviewing dozens of witnesses, including the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden and the president\u2019s brother James Biden, Republicans have not produced any evidence that shows Joe Biden was directly involved or benefited from his family\u2019s businesses while in public office.",

            "Former President Donald Trump spent his first day on trial as a criminal defendant lashing out at the judge and prosecutors, casting himself as a victim and angrily posting on social media",
            "NEW YORK -- Former President Donald Trump began his day as a criminal defendant lashing out at the judge and prosecutors, casting himself as a victim and angrily posting on social media.",
            "In other words: a familiar routine.",
            "But inside the courtroom, which was closed to TV cameras, Trump was a different man \u2014 reserved and muted in a stark departure from his feisty approach to other legal troubles.",
            "The contrast spoke to the gravity of his situation. Trump is now the first former president ever to stand trial on criminal charges and faces the prospect, if he loses, of becoming the first major American presidential candidate in history to run as a convicted felon.",
            "Trump is accused in the case of falsifying business records to hide alleged hush money payments made to a porn star to keep her from going public during his 2016 campaign with allegations of an affair.",
            "The trial is expected to last at least six weeks and Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is required to attend every day court is in session \u2014 a schedule that will dramatically alter his daily life and his ability to campaign in battleground states.",
            "So Trump instead brought his campaign to the courthouse, delivering statements before and after the day\u2019s proceedings, which he again cast as nothing more than a politically motivated effort by his rivals to hinder his campaign.",
            "\u201cThis is political persecution,\u201d he steamed after arriving with a phalanx of lawyers and several senior aides, but without his wife or other family members. \u201cThis is an assault on our country,\u201d he went on.",
            "Trump is already well practiced in the art of campaigning from the courtroom. In addition to appearances related to his four criminal trials, Trump this year voluntarily attended most days of his civil fraud trial as well as a defamation case brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll, who had accused Trump of rape.",
            "Those two trials did not end well for Trump: The former president was found liable in both cases, and now owes over half a billion dollars, including interest.",
            "During those hearings, Trump was often admonished by the judges, who instructed him to be quiet or answer questions more succinctly. At one point, the judge in the Carroll suit threatened to kick Trump out of the courtroom for speaking loudly. Another day he stormed out. Trump also openly sparred with the judge in his civil fraud case, including from the witness stand.",
            "Such behavior would not be tolerated in a criminal courtroom and Judge Juan Merchan made clear Trump could be sent to jail and prosecuted separately if he were to engage in such disruptive behavior.",
            "On Monday, Trump did not.",
            "At times, he was seen whispering and passing notes with Todd Blanche, his lead attorney. But during other stretches, Trump slouched forward, casting his gaze toward the ceiling, or leaned back in his chair with his arms folded and his eyes closed.",
            "Every movement was memorialized by a small pool of reporters inside. As he entered the courtroom, Trump \"paused for a split second\" and \u201clicked his lips\u201d before walking up the courtroom\u2019s center aisle. When he was introduced as the defendant, Trump turned and gave prospective jurors \"a little tight-lipped smirk.\u201d Later, when he exited the courtroom for a break, Trump glared at a New York Times reporter who earlier had reported Trump had fallen asleep in his chair.",
            "While his body language was carefully parsed, he was seen more than heard.",
            "During the first day of his trial, Trump said just five words on the record \u2014 \u201cYes\u201d once, and \u201cYes, sir\u201d twice \u2014 as he was read his so-called \u201cParker warnings\" informing him that his right to be present at the trial could be revoked if he acted out and that he could be sent to jail for disruptive behavior.",
            "It remains unclear how long Trump's restraint will last as the trial drags on.",
            "The sterile, fluorescent-lit courtroom is a world away from the gilded Mar-a-Lago club where he has taken up residency in his post-presidential life. There he is surrounded by doting staff and ardent supporters who deliver standing ovations every night as he enters the dining room.",
            "In the courtroom, Trump was introduced to jurors not as president \u2014 as his aides still call him \u2014 but \u201cMr. Donald J. Trump\" \u2014 and faced restraints, including the prospect that he might not be granted permission to attend his youngest son\u2019s high school graduation.",
            "The judge has not ruled on the matter, but did bar Trump from traveling to Washington next Thursday, when the Supreme Court will take up his argument that, as a former president, he is immune from prosecution.",
            "\u201cWe think that it is important for the court to remind Mr. Trump that he is a criminal defendant and that he is under the court\u2019s supervision,\" one prosecutor, Christopher Conroy, said.",
            "With Trump stuck in New York for the foreseeable future, aides have been planning rallies and other political events on weekends and on Wednesdays, when court is not supposed to be in session. Merchan said Monday that Wednesdays could be added if he trial falls behind schedule.",
            "Aides are also considering possible events around New York after court ends for the day. Trump has often talked about wanting to campaign in his home state, even though New York remains overwhelmingly Democratic.",
            "He is also expected continue to speak from the courthouse and hold press conferences to spin each day's proceedings, as he has in his other trials.",
            "While Trump has complained about being taken off the campaign trail, he has been keeping a relatively light schedule of public events since he locked up the GOP nomination last month, with most of his rallies scheduled on weekends anyway. Instead, he has been focused on fundraising as he tries to close the gap with his Democratic rival, President Joe Biden.",
            "He is also expected to rely more heavily on surrogates. On Monday, allies including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds \u2014 all potential vice presidential or cabinet picks \u2014 fanned out across cable networks to blast the case.",
            "Trump's indictments proved beneficial during the primaries, helping him rake in tens of millions of dollars from angry supporters and denying his GOP rivals the media spotlight as they were trying to gain traction.",
            "It's unclear, however, how a criminal trial and possible conviction resonate with the broader general election audience, which includes more moderate and independent voters that could decide the race.",
            "Nearly half of registered voters, 46%, said in a recent NYT/Siena College poll that Trump \u201cshould be found guilty\u201d in the New York trial. And about 6 in 10 said the charges were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d serious.",
            "The details of the case are salacious \u2014 involving a porn star, tabloids and hush money payments. But the case is widely see as posing less of a legal risk to Trump than his other cases, which accuse him of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election and of charges under the Espionage Act over his hoarding of classified documents that could lead to serious jail time.",
            "But the hush money case could be the only one that makes it to trial before November\u2019s vote.",
            "Biden's campaign, meanwhile, ignored Monday's proceedings as his aides seek to avoid the appearance of judicial interference.",
            "Campaign officials said Monday that they will instead focus on continuing to present a political split-screen between the two men, with the president focused on governing and Trump focused on himself.",
            "That contrast was especially striking this weekend, as Iran launched an attack against Israel and Biden worked to prevent a wider Middle East escalation, speaking by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II.",
            "He'll spend the week campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania, with events planned in Scranton, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as Trump remains in court.",

            "A former U.S. Marine has been sentenced to nine years in prison for firebombing a Southern California Planned Parenthood clinic in 2022",
            "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A former U.S. Marine was sentenced Monday to nine years in prison for firebombing a Southern California Planned Parenthood clinic in 2022, federal prosecutors prosecutors said.",
            "Chance Brannon, 24, pleaded guilty in November to four felony counts, including malicious destruction of property by fire and explosives and intentional damage to a reproductive health services facility,",
            "Brannon, of San Juan Capistrano, California, also admitted that he made plans for additional attacks on a second Planned Parenthood clinic, a Southern California Edison substation and an LGBTQ pride night celebration at Dodger Stadium, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said in a statement.",
            "Brannon was an active-duty Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton at the time of the bombing at the clinic in Costa Mesa on March 13, 2022. Surveillance footage showed Brannon and another person throwing a Molotov cocktail at the front door of the medical facility. The clinic was closed at the time and no one was injured.",
            "During the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney said Brannon \u201cengaged in cruel and indefensible domestic terrorism.\u201d",
            "He has been in federal custody since his arrest in June 2023.",
            "Brannon conspired with two others to use an explosive device to destroy a commercial property, according to his plea agreement.",
            "His co-defendants, Tibet Ergul and Xavier Batten, have pleaded guilty to the charges against them. They are scheduled to be sentenced in May.",

            "A former detainee at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison described to jurors in Virginia the abuse he suffered in more than a month of incarceration in 2003",
            "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former detainee at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison described to jurors Monday the type of abuse that is reminiscent of the scandal that erupted there 20 years ago: beatings, being stripped naked and threatened with dogs, stress positions meant to induce exhaustion and pain.",
            "The testimony from Salah Al-Ejaili, a former Al-Jazeera journalist who spent more than a month at Abu Ghraib in 2003, marks the first time that survivors of the U.S. prison in Iraq have been able to bring their claims of torture to a U.S. jury.",
            "Al-Ejaili and two other Abu Ghraib detainees are suing Virginia-based military contractor CACI, accusing the company of contributing to their torture by sending over civilian interrogators as part of an Army contract. The suit cites evidence in government investigations that CACI contractors encouraged military police to \u201csoften up\u201d detainees ahead of their interrogations.",
            "CACI's lawyer, John O'Connor, acknowledged that some Abu Ghraib detainees suffered horrific abuse, but offered a three-pronged defense for the company in his opening statement to the jury.",
            "First, he questioned whether the three detainees who filed the lawsuit can actually prove they themselves were abused. They are not pictured in the widely circulated photographs that leaked in 2004 when news of the abuse broke and shocked the world. He told the jury that official records show no formal interrogations of Al-Ejaili, for instance, even though he testified that he was interrogated many times, and frequently beaten at the outset of each interrogation.",
            "The jury received a written declaration from the U.S. government confirming that no formal interrogation records exist, but that declaration also vaguely said that \u201cother information\u201d exists that might show a CACI interrogator questioned Al-Ejaili at one point.",
            "CACI's lawyer also said that even if the three plaintiffs were abused, there's no evidence that CACI interrogators inflicted abuse on them. He said the soldiers seen smiling in photos next to naked, abused detainees were the ones who inflicted the abuse, and they were rightly convicted of crimes in military trials long ago.",
            "\u201cThey were MPs who were sadistic, who did it on their own, and without any encouragement,\u201d O'Connor said, of the range in military police.",
            "Lastly, he said that even if CACI employees engaged in wrongdoing, it was the U.S. military, not the company, that oversaw the interrogators' conduct. He rejected the notion that CACI civilians decided on their own to abuse detainees.",
            "\u201cThe Army is pretty jealous about who has control of operations in a war zone,\u201d he argued.",
            "The plaintiffs' lawyer, Baher Azmy, said it's irrelevant whether CACI interrogators directly inflicted abuse on his clients. The company is liable, he said, because CACI interrogators conspired with military police by urging them to abuse detainees before questioning.",
            "He said the jury will hear from two Army generals, Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba and Maj. Gen. George Fay, who concluded from an investigation that there was a void in the chain of command that was filled by civilians. Taguba's report concluded that at least one CACI interrogator should be held accountable for instructing military police to set up conditions that amounted to physical abuse.",
            "\u201cThis case is about one of the most disturbing and shameful events in recent American history,\u201d Azmy said at the outset of his opening statement.",
            "The trial at U.S. District Court in Alexandria, which was delayed for more than 15 years amid legal wrangling and multiple appeals, is now moving at a breakneck pace. On Monday alone, a jury was seated, opening arguments were heard, and three key witnesses testified, including Al-Ejaili; a former CACI interrogator, Torin Nelson, who testified about his concerns about the actions of some of his colleagues; and former Army Cpl. Charles Graner, one of the military police who was tried and convicted in courts-martial for abusing detainees.",
            "Nelson testified that the other interrogators lacked experience, and he was dismayed when he saw unprofessional comments on their reports, like an interrogator who noted in one report that a detainee \u201cis crying like a little baby in the corner.\u201d",
            "On cross-examination, he said that he had not witnessed physical abuse by any CACI interrogator.",
            "\u201cI had concerns but I wasn't witnessing anything with my own eyes,\u201d Nelson said.",
            "Graner's testimony came in the form of a recorded 2013 video deposition that was played to the jury in which he said civilian interrogators gave him instructions on how to handle detainees, and told him he was doing a good job.",
            "Al-Ejaili's testimony was emotional and he choked up several times as he described the abuse. He recalled that he was naked in a cold cell and asked a female soldier if he could have something to wear. She returned with red women's underwear.",
            "On another occasion, investigators handcuffed his hands to a pipe while his feet dangled. He told the jury, through an Arabic interpreter, that it felt \u201cas if your shoulders are being pulled from their place.\u201d",
            "He said being able to tell his story now to a jury, even 20 years later, was important to him.",
            "\u201cIt's a big opportunity to tell people my story,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps it's like a form of treatment or a remedy.\u201d",

            "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has announced the framework of a $237 billion budget that includes broad plans to drive new housing construction, address the influx of migrants and crack down on illegal marijuana shops",
            "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday announced the framework of a $237 billion budget that includes broad plans to drive new housing construction, address the influx of migrants and crack down on illegal marijuana shops.",
            "Hochul, a Democrat, described the announcement as the \u201cparameters of a conceptual agreement\" on the budget, which is about two weeks late, that was struck with leaders of the state Senate and Assembly after a series of backroom negotiations.",
            "\u201cYou can\u2019t get to the legislature for consideration unless we have agreement on the package to go forth,\" Hochul told reporters at the Capitol, adding, \"It takes a little time to get to the final resolution but I've explained what I feel there's agreement on.\"",
            "Still, the governor's announcement appeared to have caught lawmakers off guard, with officials still in the process of holding meetings and working out the specifics of the spending plan.",
            "\u201cI think it was a surprise for all of us in the Senate,\u201d said state Sen. Liz Krueger, a high-ranking Democrat.",
            "The Senate and Assembly, both controlled by Democrats, would need to approve the budget before it could become law.",
            "The housing deal outlined by Hochul would include a new tax break for developers to incentivize building and a set of tenant protections to make it harder to raise rents and evict people in certain cases, though specifics were not detailed. It also includes plans to use commercial properties and state lands for residential housing.",
            "The sweeping housing agreement had become a sticking point in negotiations, with top officials moving to craft a deal that leads to more new, affordable homes while protecting tenants and luring developers to build.",
            "The spending plan would also set aside $2.4 billion for the state to address numerous migrants who have overwhelmed New York City\u2019s homeless shelters, following a proposal from Hochul to provide short-term shelter services, legal assistance and more.",
            "And Hochul said there was an agreement on a new strategy to combat unlicensed marijuana storefronts, which have become ubiquitous in the city following the state's legalization of recreational weed sales, through a proposal to make it easier for local authorities to close the black market shops.",

            "GOP House lawmakers gave near-final passage to the bill on Monday, putting Tennessee just a few hurdles away from joining states such as Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana and North Carolina with similar laws. Virginia has such guidance for school boards, as well. The bill goes back for another vote in the Senate, which had already passed a version of it, before it can go to Gov. Bill Lee's desk for his signature.",
            "The bill's progression comes as Tennessee Republican lawmakers have established the state as one of the most eager to pass policies aimed at the LGBTQ+ community as Republicans pursue legislation nationwide.",
            "During Monday's limited but heated House floor hearing, Democrats took turns alleging that their Republican colleagues were constantly finding new ways to bully LGBTQ+ kids.",
            "\u201cThese are the most vulnerable kids in our state who are just trying to make it out of middle school alive,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn. \u201cAnd we are weaponizing their identities instead of actually passing bills that help Tennesseans.\u201d",
            "Audible gasps could be heard from the public galleries when the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Mary Littleton, argued that the legislation was needed so parents could know if their student would need therapy.",
            "\u201cI feel like the parents, they have the right to know what\u2019s happening in the school with their children,\u201d Littleton said. \u201cAnd I also think that possibly they could get that child some therapy that could help them solve their problems and make their way through school.\u201d",
            "Littleton also confirmed she did not speak to any transgender students before introducing the proposal but said some teachers had told her that they did not want the responsibility of having such information.",
            "According to the legislation that passed Monday, school employees would be required to pass on information about a student to an administrator, who would have to tell the parent. That includes a student asking for action to affirm their gender identity, such as using a different name or pronoun.",
            "However, the bill also would allow parents or the state's attorney general to sue if they felt the school district was not following this new law.",
            "The proposal is just one of several targeting the LGBTQ+ community over the years.",
            "Earlier this year, Tennessee Republicans passed a measure that would allow LGBTQ+ foster children to be placed with families that hold anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs. Gov. Lee signed the bill into law last week. Lawmakers are still considering criminalizing adults who help minors receive gender-affirming care without parental consent.",
            "Meanwhile, Tennessee Republicans have banned gender-affirming care for most minors, attempted to limit events where certain drag performers may appear, and allow, but not require, LGBTQ+ children to be placed with families that hold anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs.",
            "In schools, they already have approved legal protections for teachers who do not use a transgender student's preferred pronoun, restricted transgender athletes, limited transgender students' use of bathrooms aligning with their gender identity and allowed parents to opt students out of classroom conversations about gender and sexuality.",

            "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders ' office potentially violated state laws on purchasing, state property and government records when it purchased a $19,000 lectern for the Republican governor that's prompted nationwide attention, an audit requested by lawmakers said Monday.",
            "Legislative auditors referred the findings in the long-awaited audit of the lectern to local prosecutors and the attorney general, and lawmakers planned to hold a hearing Tuesday on the report. The report cited several potential legal violations, including paying for the lectern before it was delivered and the handling of records regarding the purchase.",
            "Sanders' office, which has dismissed questions about the lectern, called the audit's findings \u201cdeeply flawed\" and a \u201cwaste of taxpayer resources and time.\"",
            "\u201cNo laws were broken,\u201d her office said in a response filed with the report. \u201cNo fraud was committed.\u201d",
            "Arkansas lawmakers last year approved the request to review the purchase of the lectern, which had been the focus of nationwide scrutiny, including over its cost. The lectern for Sanders, who served as press secretary for former President Donald Trump and has been widely viewed as a potential candidate to be his running mate, has drawn attention ranging from late night host Jimmy Kimmel to The New York Times.",
            "The blue and wood paneled lectern was bought in June with a state credit card for $19,029.25 from an events company in Virginia. The Republican Party of Arkansas reimbursed the state for the purchase on Sept. 14, and Sanders\u2019 office has called the use of the state credit card an accounting error. Sanders\u2019 office said it received the lectern in August.",
            "The item has not been seen at Sanders\u2019 public events. Sanders posted a video on the social platform X featuring the lectern and the words \u201cCome and Take It\u201d shortly after the audit\u2019s release late Monday afternoon.",
            "Pulaski County Prosecutor Will Jones' office said it had received the audit and would review it, but said it wouldn't comment further.",
            "Auditors said in the report they were unable to determine whether the lectern's cost was reasonable. The report said the three out-of-state vendors involved in its purchase did not respond to numerous requests by auditors for information about the lectern.",
            "Sanders' office and auditors disputed whether the governor and other constitutional officers are subject to the purchasing and property rules she's accused of violating. The audit said the governor's office did not follow the steps laid out in state law for agencies to dispose of state property.",
            "\u201c(Arkansas legislative audit) maintains that the podium and road case remain state property,\u201d the audit said.",
            "Sanders' office said in its response that the laws on purchasing and property cited only apply to state agencies, not constitutional officers. A nonbinding legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin requested by Sanders and issued last week made the same argument.",
            "\u201cI am perplexed to see that a significant portion of Legislative Audit's analysis rests on the mistaken conclusion that the governor's office is a \u2018state agency\u2019 for the purposes of certain statutes,\u201d Griffin said Monday in a written statement.",
            "The lectern\u2019s purchase emerged last year just as Sanders was urging lawmakers to broadly limit the public\u2019s access to records about her administration. Sanders ultimately signed a measure blocking release of her travel and security records after broader exemptions faced backlash from media groups and some conservatives.",
            "The purchase was initially uncovered by Matt Campbell, a lawyer and blogger who has a long history of open records requests that have uncovered questionable spending and other misdeeds by elected officials.",
            "The audit said Sanders' office potentially illegally tampered with public records when the words \u201cto be reimbursed\u201d were added to the original invoice for the lectern only after the state GOP paid for it in September. Sanders' office disputed that finding, calling handwritten notes on invoices \u201ca common bookkeeping practice.\u201d",
            "The audit also said the office potentially violated the law when a shipping document related to the lectern was shredded by a member of Sanders' staff. Sanders' office said the document, the \u201cbill of lading,\u201d was inadvertently misplaced and that a replacement was provided to auditors when that was discovered.",
            "The lectern was purchased from Beckett Events LLC, a Virginia-based company run by political consultant and lobbyist Virginia Beckett. According to a breakdown from Beckett Events that was included in the audit, the total cost included $11,575 for the lectern, $2,500 for a \u201cconsulting fee,\u201d and $2,200 for the road case. The cost also included shipping, delivery and a credit card processing fee.",
            "Similar lectern models are listed online for $7,500 or less. Sanders has said the one purchased by the state had additional features that contributed to its cost, including a custom height. The audit said the lectern included a light but not a microphone or any electronic components. Auditors saw and measured the lectern at state GOP headquarters, the report said.",
            "House Minority Leader Tippi McCullough, a Democrat from Little Rock who sits on the audit committee, said she wants more answers from the governor\u2019s office on the findings.",
            "\u201cWe need to get to the bottom of it, and we need to make sure that people are held accountable and things are right going forward,\u201d McCullough said.",
            "Republican Senate President Bart Hester said he wasn't concerned about the audit's findings, and said the legislative audit was wrong in applying the purchasing and property laws to the governor's office.

            "\u201cMore importantly, it shows there wasn't some bombshell,\u201d Hester said.",
            "The report had drawn unusually intense attention to the Division of Legislative Audit, which issues more than 1,000 audits of state and local government each year. Hours before the report was released, lawmakers on the audit committee were allowed to view it in a room at the Capitol but could not take notes or copies of it.",
            "The audit was issued days after lawmakers began a legislative session focused on the state's budget.",
            "Republican Sen. Jimmy Hickey, who had sought the audit, declined to comment late Monday afternoon.",
            "The audit is the first of two that Hickey requested that lawmakers approved last year. The audit committee also approved another audit looking at the travel and security records that Sanders retroactively shielded from public release under the changes to the state's open records law.",

            "Tennessee\u2019s Republican-led Legislature has unanimously passed a bill that would involuntarily commit certain criminal defendants for inpatient treatment",
            "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee's Republican-led Legislature unanimously passed a bill Monday that would involuntarily commit certain criminal defendants for inpatient treatment and temporarily remove their gun rights if they are ruled incompetent to stand trial due to intellectual disability or mental illness.",
            "The proposal is named for college student Jillian Ludwig, who was killed in November after she was hit by a stray bullet while walking near the Belmont University campus in Nashville.",
            "The suspect charged in her shooting had faced three charges of assault with a deadly weapon from 2021, but a judge dismissed the charges when three doctors testified that he was incompetent to stand trial because he is severely intellectually disabled. Because he did not qualify for involuntary commitment to a mental health institution, he was released from prison.",
            "Ludwig's family traveled from New Jersey to be on hand Monday while the House voted on the bill and then honored her with a resolution. Her mother cried and held a photo of her as the vote was cast on the bill, and as the resolution was read.",
            "\u201cYou sent your little girl off to another state, and you hoped it was safe,\u201d House Majority Leader William Lamberth said, speaking to Ludwig's family in the gallery. \u201cHer life matters. We are working to make sure this state is safer today.\u201d",
            "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s desk for his signature.",
            "The bill's requirements would kick in for defendants charged with felonies or class A misdemeanors. The person would remain committed until they are deemed competent to stand trial, or until the court approves a mandatory outpatient treatment plan that accounts for the community's safety.",
            "A defendant could attempt to convince a judge not to commit them by providing clear and convincing evidence that they don't pose a substantial likelihood of serious harm.",
            "The bill would make it a state-level class A misdemeanor to possess or try to buy a gun when a judge deems someone mentally \"defective\u201d or commits them to a mental institution. Federal law already includes criminal charges in that situation.",
            "Gov. Lee's latest budget proposal includes $2.1 million to help fund possible additional involuntary commitment under the state Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.",
            "Tempers briefly flared after Democratic Rep. Bo Mitchell said the bill was a step in the right direction, but also chided Republicans for shutting down discussion of gun control bills \u2014 a trend that the GOP supermajority have maintained for nearly a year after a shooter killed six people, including three young children, at a private Nashville school. He suggested passage of a red-flag style proposal to keep guns away from people judged to be a danger to themselves or others, or a three-day waiting period for gun purchases.",
            "Lamberth responded that Mitchell was pontificating on other proposals.",
            "\u201cThis is the step that I took. This is the bill that I filed. This is the family I'm fighting for,\u201d Lamberth said, his voicing rising to a shout.",
            "Mitchell responded angrily.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t act like I don\u2019t care about that family,\" Mitchell said, yelling that Republicans should have already enacted gun control laws that could have prevented tragedies like what happened to Jillian Ludwig.",
            "The discussion cooled down when Republican Rep. Ryan Williams introduced Ludwig's family and friends.",
            "Over in the Senate, the debate was much more restrained and limited on Monday. Only two Democrats spoke in favor of the bill but raised some concerns about the state having enough resources to enforce the proposed changes effectively.",
            "The chamber then voted unanimously to send the proposal to the governor.",
            "\u201cThis is the first time that I know of that we've addressed gun violence in this state,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell.",

            "LAS VEGAS -- A Las Vegas lawyer and his wife had been in the middle of a contentious battle for custody of her children from a previous marriage when the woman's former father-in-law, also an attorney, fatally shot them last week during a deposition hearing in the case, according to authorities and relatives.",
            "The coroner's office in Las Vegas identified the victims as lawyer Dennis Prince and his wife, Ashley. Both were shot multiple times, the coroner's office said, before 77-year-old Joseph Houston shot and killed himself.",
            "Gunfire erupted just minutes after the deposition hearing began on the morning of April 8 at Dennis Prince's law firm, Prince Law Group, in the affluent Summerlin neighborhood.",
            "Seven people were in the room at the time of the shooting, police said. The four others, including a court reporter, were able to quickly escape and call police.",
            "At a news conference Monday, Ashley Prince's parents said their daughter was previously married to Houston\u2019s son and had been trying for years to gain sole custody of their two children. Houston, a lawyer in Nevada since 1974, had been representing his son in the custody battle, court records show.",
            "Julie Page said they will continue their daughter\u2019s fight to win custody of the children, ages 4 and 5.",
            "\u201cOur daughter Ashley was a devoted and fierce protector of her children,\u201d Page said, choking back tears as she told reporters that her daughter \"would have never given up the fight for her children.\u201d",
            "The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which is investigating the shooting, didn't immediately respond Monday to a request for comment on the family's statement.",
            "Bryce Page said Monday that his sister \u201cwas beaming from her core\u201d after she met Dennis Prince. He said his sister realized a lifelong dream to build a \u201cwarm, loving environment\u201d for her family after she recently welcomed her first child with Dennis Prince.",
            "Prince was a trial lawyer in Las Vegas for 30 years and headed Prince Law Group, where the shooting unfolded.",
            "He started that firm after building a reputation as a top attorney in Nevada personal injury, product liability, negligence and insurance cases. His professional profiles say he tried more than 90 cases to verdict and had more than a dozen published state Supreme Court cases.",
            "\u201cWith profound sadness, Prince Law Group would like to thank everyone who has reached out to us with heartfelt messages of concern and sympathy over the tragic violence that occurred this morning in our offices,\u201d the law group said in a statement last week.",

            "Without attributing blame, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said his agency has been able to confirm three attacks against the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant since April 7.",
            "\u201cThese reckless attacks must cease immediately,\u201d he told the Security Council. \u201cThough, fortunately, they have not led to a radiological incident this time, they significantly increase the risk \u2026 where nuclear safety is already compromised.\u201d",
            "The remote-controlled nature of the drones that have attacked the plant means that it is impossible to definitively determine who launched them, Grossi told reporters after the meeting.",

            "Zaporizhzhia sits in Russian-controlled territory in southeastern Ukraine and has six nuclear reactors.",
            "Fears of a nuclear catastrophe have been at the forefront since Russian troops occupied the plant shortly after invading in February 2022. Continued fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces \u2014 as well as the tense supply situation at the plant \u2014 have raised the specter of a disaster.",
            "Ukraine and its allies on Monday again blamed Russia for dangers at the site, with the United States saying, \u201cRussia does not care about these risks.\u201d",
            "\u201cIf it did, it would not continue to forcibly control the plant,\u201d U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told the Security Council, which met at the initiative of the U.S. and Slovenia.",

Fighting in the southern part of Ukraine where it is located has raised the specter of a potential nuclear disaster like the one at Chernobyl in 1986, where a reactor exploded and blew deadly radiation across a vast area.",
            "Neither Russia nor Ukraine in recent months has been able to make significant advances along the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line crossing eastern and southern Ukraine. Drones, artillery and missiles have featured heavily in what has become a war of attrition.",
            "Russia and Ukraine have frequently traded accusations over the Zaporizhzhia plant.",

            "Boeing is defending the integrity of the fuselages on two of its largest planes",
            "Boeing is defending the integrity of the fuselages on two of its largest planes, which have come under criticism from a whistleblower who warns that panels on the outside of one of the planes could eventually break apart during flight.",
            "Two Boeing engineering executives went into detail Monday to describe how panels are fitted together, particularly on the 787 Dreamliner. They suggested the 787's carbon-composite skin is nearly impervious to metal fatigue that weakens conventional aluminum fuselages.",
            "Their comments during a lengthy media briefing served as both a response to news reports last week about the whistleblower's allegations and a preemptive strike before he testifies to a congressional panel on Wednesday.",
            "The whistleblower, Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, said excessive force was applied to fit panels together on the 787 assembly line, raising the risk of fatigue, or microscopic cracking in the material that could cause it break apart.",
            "The Boeing officials described how sections of a fuselage are brought together, shims are added to fill gaps, holes are drilled and cleaned, and fasteners attached to apply \u201cpull-up force\u201d that 99% of the time results in margins no greater than .005 inches (0.127 millimeters) apart \u2014 the width of a human hair, they said. A gap problem was discovered in 2019 between two panels, which led to design and assembly changes, they said.",
            "Boeing conducted testing replicating 165,000 flights with no findings of fatigue in the composite structure, Steve Chisholm, Boeing's vice president of structural engineering, said. The average 787 makes 600 flights a year, he said.",
            "The company said planes already in use are proving safe. Chisholm said 671 Dreamliners have undergone the intensive inspections for 6-year-old planes and eight have undergone 12-year inspections with no evidence of fatigue in the composite skins.",
            "Cracks have been found on metallic parts, including a piece above where the wings join the fuselage, and Boeing issued inspection guidelines for those parts, the officials said.",
            "The 787 Dreamliner is a two-aisle plane that has often been used on international flights since its debut in 2011. The composite material makes the plane lighter, contributing to better fuel efficiency.",
            "A series of battery fires briefly grounded the planes. Deliveries of the aircraft have been stopped at times because of questions about gaps between fuselage panels that were wider than Boeing\u2019s standards allowed, the use of unapproved titanium parts from a supplier in Italy, and flaws in a pressure bulkhead.",
            "The Federal Aviation Administration must inspect and approve each 787 that rolls off the assembly line before it can be flown to an airline customer.",
            "The whistleblower Salehpour claims that after he raised safety concerns about the 787, Boeing transferred him to work on an older widebody plane, the 777. He told the Seattle Times that he saw workers jumping on fuselage panels to get them in alignment, which Boeing disputes.",
            "The New York Times reported that the FAA is investigating Salehpour\u2019s claims. The FAA, while not commenting specifically on Salehpour, said it investigates all safety reports.",
            "Boeing says it is \u201cfully confident\u201d in both planes.",
            "Salehpour is the latest in a line of Boeing whistleblowers to come forward, often alleging retaliation for raising safety concerns. The company said it encourages employees to speak up about problems.",
            "Lisa Fahl, the vice president of engineering for Boeing airplane programs, said employee reports have \u201cexploded\u201d \u2014 with as many reports in January and February as were filed in all of 2023 \u2014 \u201cwhich is what we want.\u201d",

            "Nine-year-old Cal Clifford had always wanted a pet octopus",
            "The one thing 9-year-old Cal Clifford wanted more than anything since he was a toddler was a pet octopus.",
            "The boy's family in rural Edmond, Oklahoma, humored him with toy versions of an eight-legged mollusk, but as Cal got older it became clear that only the real thing would do.",
            "The child's father, 36-year-old dentist Cameron Clifford, researched the possibility with a local aquarium store and before long Terrance the California two-spot octopus, also known as a bimac, was living in a watery enclosure at the family home southwest of Oklahoma City.",
            "\u201cWe really like to encourage our children's interests,\u201d said the older Clifford. \u201cIt's magical to see a kid embrace their dreams and bring them to fruition. Cal has been infatuated with the natural world and with marine biology since he was very little.\"",
            "A popular TikTok saga was launched with the father narrating the tale of Terrance the cephalopod, using a faux British accent generated by the social media app. Eventually, hundreds of thousands of people were following.",
            "Within weeks, the tale took an surprise twist when it was learned Terrance was actually a female as it laid some 50 eggs that the family initially assumed were unfertilized. Several weeks after that, teeny near-transparent octopus babies began hatching and were given names like Rocket Larry, Squid Cudi, Swim Shady, Jay-Sea and Sea-Yonc\u00e9",
            "Cal had burst into tears at the family dinner table when his father first announced that the local aquarium store had told him adopting an octopus would be possible.",
            "Father and son together researched what was needed, deciding on a saltwater tank and water cycling system and ensuring they would be able to source food for the soft-bodied sea creature.",
            "The family's younger son Lyle and mom Kari also joined the project in their own ways. A family friend who is a reptile scientist has provided support and advice.",
            "While female octopuses usually die soon after laying their eggs, Clifford said Terrance remains alive four months later.",
            "Clifford said the family has gained much from the experience.",
            "\u201cAside from the physical, financial and emotional requirements of owning a species such as a bimac, you will learn a lot about yourself in the process,\u201d the Arizona-born Clifford told TikTok followers in his app-generated accent. \u201cThere's always some valve or seal that's not completely closed, and your storm resistant carpet isn't rated for gallons and gallons of seawater. You'll learn that seawater and electricity don't always get along.\"",
            "\u201cYou will learn new things and meet incredible people and will learn that wildlife is magnificent,\" he added. \u201cBut most of all, you'll learn to love a not-so-tiny octopus like Terrance.\u201d",

            "Wildlife experts are bringing butterflies back to the Presidio National Park in San Francisco as part of an effort to restore native ecosystems",
            "SAN FRANCISCO -- More than 80 years ago, a beautiful butterfly called Xerces Blue that once fluttered among San Francisco's coastal dunes went extinct as stately homes, museums and parks ate up its habitat, marking the first butterfly species in the United States to disappear due to human development.",
            "But thanks to years of research and modern technology a close relative of the shimmery iridescent butterfly species has been reintroduced to the dunes in Presidio National Park in San Francisco. Dozens of Silvery Blue butterflies \u2014 the closest living relatives of the Xerces Blue \u2014 were released in the restored habitat last week, officials said Monday.",
            "Scientists with San Francisco\u2019s California Academy of Sciences utilized the Academy\u2019s genetic sequencing capabilities and analyzed Xerces Blue specimens in their vast collection to confirm a group of Silvery Blues in Monterey County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of San Francisco, could successfully fill the ecological gap left by the Xerces Blue.",
            "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a Jurassic Park-style de-extinction project, but it will have a major impact,\u201d said Durrell Kapan, a senior research fellow and the lead Academy researcher on the project. \u201cThe Silvery Blue will act as an ecological \u2018stand-in\u2019 for the Xerces Blue, performing the same ecosystem functions as both a pollinator and a critical member of the food web.\"",
            "The iconic butterfly, whose name inspired the Xerces Society, an environmental nonprofit that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, went extinct in the 1940s.",
            "Chris Grinter, the collection manager of entomology at California Academy of Sciences, said it all started by using their collections and \"modern technology, genome sequencing to go back and extract genomes from these extinct butterflies that are over 100, 150 years old.\u201d",
            "Meanwhile, the Presidio Trust and other organizations worked to restore the butterflies\u2019 native dunes, planting deerweed \u2014 a preferred host plant of the Xerces Blue and the Silvery Blue butterflies.",
            "Wildlife experts collected dozens of Silvery Blue butterflies in Monterey County, marked them for future identification and transported them to San Francisco, feeding them a few drops of fruit punch-flavored Gatorade along the way.",
            "The team will continue to track their movements using high-resolution photographs to identify their markings and learn ways to replicate the habitat regeneration lessons learned, officials said Scott Sampson, executive director of the California Academy of Sciences.",
            "\u201cThe lessons we learn from the Silvery Blue here in our backyard could serve as a model for regenerating other ecosystems across California and beyond,\u201d he said.",

            "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing Idaho to enforce its ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth while lawsuits over the law proceed, reversing lower courts.",
            "The justices' order Monday allows the state to put in a place a 2023 law that subjects physicians to up to 10 years in prison if they provide hormones, puberty blockers or other gender-affirming care to people under age 18. Under the court\u2019s order, the two transgender teens who sued to challenge the law still will be able to obtain care.",
            "The court's three liberal justices would have kept the law on hold. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that it would have been better to let the case proceed \u201cunfettered by our intervention.\u201d",
            "Justice Neil Gorsuch of the conservative majority wrote that it is \u201ca welcome development\u201d that the court is reining in an overly broad lower court order.",
            "A federal judge in Idaho had blocked the law in its entirety after determining that it was necessary to do so to protect the teens, who are identified under pseudonyms in court papers.",
            "Lawyers for the teens wrote in court papers that the teens' \u201cgender dysphoria has been dramatically alleviated as a result of puberty blockers and estrogen therapy.\u201d",
            "The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the teens and their families, called the Supreme Court's order \u201can awful result for transgender youth and their families across the state. Today\u2019s ruling allows the state to shut down the care that thousands of families rely on while sowing further confusion and disruption.\u201d",
            "Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador said in a statement that the law \u201censures children are not subjected to these life-altering drugs and procedures. Those suffering from gender dysphoria deserve love, support, and medical care rooted in biological reality. Denying the basic truth that boys and girls are biologically different hurts our kids.\u201d",
            "Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.",
            "Medical professionals define gender dysphoria as psychological distress experienced by those whose gender expression does not match their gender identity.",
            "The action comes as the justices also may soon consider whether to take up bans in Kentucky and Tennessee that an appeals court allowed to be enforced in the midst of legal fights.",
            "At least 23 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A federal judge struck down Arkansas\u2019 ban as unconstitutional. Montana\u2019s ban also is temporarily on hold.",
            "The states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.",

            "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine will become the latest to join a multistate effort to elect the president by popular vote with the Democratic governor's announcement Monday that she's letting the proposal become law without her signature.",
            "Under the proposed compact, each state would allocate all its electoral votes to whoever wins the national popular vote for president, regardless of how individual states voted in an election.",
            "But the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is on hold for now \u2014 and won\u2019t play a role in the upcoming November election.",
            "Gov. Janet Mills said she understands that there are different facets to the debate. Opponents point out that the role of small states like Maine could be diminished if the electoral college ends, while proponents point out that two of the last four presidents have been elected through the electoral college system despite losing the national popular vote.",
            "Without a ranked voting system, Mills said she believes \u201cthe person who wins the most votes should become the president. To do otherwise seemingly runs counter to the democratic foundations of our country.\u201d",
            "\u201cStill, recognizing that there is merit to both sides of the argument, and recognizing that this measure has been the subject of public discussion several times before in Maine, I would like this important nationwide debate to continue and so I will allow this bill to become law without my signature,\u201d the governor said in a statement.",
            "The compact would take effect only if supporters secure pledges of states with at least 270 electoral votes. Sixteen states and Washington, D.C. have joined the compact and Maine\u2019s addition would bring the total to 209, the governor said. Other hurdles include questions of whether congressional approval is necessary to implement the compact.",
            "In Maine, one of only two states to split their electoral votes under the current system, the debate in the Maine Legislature fell along partisan lines with Republican united in opposition.",
            "Maine awards two of its four electoral votes to the statewide presidential winner along with one apiece for the winner of each congressional district. In 2016, the state split its electoral votes for the first time when Republican Donald Trump won a single electoral vote in the northern, conservative 2nd Congressional District. Trump collected an electoral vote again in his failed presidential bid in 2020.",

Cooper's first trial last November ended in a mistrial when jurors could not reach a verdict.",

Guards rush in when he refuses. Rios then runs from the cell and is quickly tackled. Five guards, including Cooper, pile on him as another officer not seen in the video says, \u201ctase him.\u201d",
            "One of the guards presses his fist into the side of Rios\u2019 head and punches him several times. Rios appears to lose consciousness about 4 minutes into the video.

            "House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for a vote on aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan this week",
            "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing toward action this week on aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, unveiling an elaborate plan Monday to break the package into separate votes to squeeze through the House's political divides on foreign policy.",
            "Facing an outright rebellion from conservatives fiercely opposed to aiding Ukraine, the Republican speaker's move on the foreign aid package was a potentially watershed moment, the first significant action on the bill after more than two months of delay. But Johnson's intention to hold four separate votes on parts of the package also left it open to being significantly altered from the $95 billion aid package the Senate passed in February.",
            "It\u2019s unclear if the House could end up with a package that is similar to the Senate\u2019s bill or something significantly different, which could complicate the months-long, painstaking effort to get Congress to approve military funding for Ukraine.",
            "\u201cWe will let the House work its will,\u201d Johnson told reporters.",
            "But as the House has struggled to act, conflicts around the world have escalated. Israel\u2019s military chief said Monday that his country will respond to Iran\u2019s weekend missile strike. And Ukraine\u2019s military head warned over the weekend that the battlefield situation in the country\u2019s east has \u201csignificantly worsened in recent days,\u201d as warming weather has allowed Russian forces to launch a fresh offensive.",
            "\u201cThere are precipitating events around the globe that we\u2019re all watching very carefully and we know the world is watching us to see how we react,\u201d Johnson said.",
            "President Joe Biden, hosting Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala at the White House, called on the House to take up the Senate funding package immediately. \u201cThey have to do it now,\u201d he said.",
            "Johnson and Biden spoke Monday, according to a person familiar with the call and granted anonymity to discuss it.",
            "Democrats in the House could be open to helping Johnson pass the aid in parts, and may even be agreeable to some of the additional measures being discussed by Republicans, such as providing some of the Ukraine economic assistance as loans.",
            "But Johnson would lose the Democratic support he needs if he strays too far into Republican-only priorities. Any overhaul to the package also risks setbacks in the Senate, where a bulk of Republicans oppose the aid for Ukraine and Democrats have become increasingly alarmed at Israel's campaign in Gaza.",
            "As House members returned to the Capitol Monday evening, Johnson huddled with fellow GOP lawmakers to lay out his strategy to gain House approval for the funding package. He said he would push to get the package to the House floor under a single debate rule that allows for separate votes on aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other foreign policy proposals.",
            "Johnson said those proposals would structure some of the funding for Kyiv as loans, allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets and place other sanctions on Iran.",
            "The GOP meeting was filled with lawmakers at odds in their approach to the conflict with Russia: Republican defense hawks, including the top lawmakers on national security committees, are pitted against populist conservatives who are fiercely opposed to continued support for Kyiv\u2019s fight.",
            "As often happens, the meeting turned into a free-for-all of ideas as Republicans tried to put their own stamp on the package but rarely found any unity. Yet Johnson\u2019s plan won over significant Republican support, said Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., as he left the meeting.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m clearly in the minority.\u201d",
            "Still, Johnson's support for Ukraine aid could further incite the populist conservatives who are already angry at his direction as speaker.",
            "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., is already threatening to oust him as speaker. As she entered the closed-door Republican meeting on Monday, she said her message to the speaker was simple: \u201cDon\u2019t fund Ukraine.\u201d",
            "But Greene did not indicate whether she would move for a quick vote on her motion to remove the speaker if the Ukraine aid is approved.",
            "\u201cI'm thinking it over,\u201d she said.",
            "Another unknown was how Donald Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner who has railed against overseas aid, would respond to the proposal. Johnson met with Trump on Friday at his club in Florida.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t spend my time worrying about motions to vacate,\u201d Johnson said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re having to govern here, and we\u2019re going to do our job.\u201d",
            "Democrats had pressured Johnson to simply take up the Senate-passed bill that would provide a total of $95 billion for the U.S. allies, as well as humanitarian support for civilians in Gaza and Ukraine.",
            "\u201cThe House must rush to Israel's aid as quickly as humanly possible, and the only way to do that is passing the Senate's supplemental ASAP,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
            "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries pledged in a letter to lawmakers to do \u201ceverything in our legislative power to confront aggression\" around the globe, and he cast the situation as similar to the lead-up to World War II.",
            "\u201cThe gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cWe must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith.\u201d",
            "Democrats have also circulated a last-ditch option, known as a discharge petition, that could force a floor vote on the aid without the speaker's approval. The petition has gained 195 lawmakers' signatures, leaving it about a dozen votes shy of the majority it would need.",
            "But Republican supporters of the Senate\u2019s Ukraine package appeared encouraged by Johnson\u2019s plan, even though they hadn\u2019t yet seen the details.",
            "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said the House proposal could \u201csignificantly delay\u201d the aid because it is four different measures that would have to be sent back to the Senate, and it\u2019s unclear whether the Senate could combine them into one. Still, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s OK because we can still respond to it.\u201d",
            "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday afternoon urged the House to take up the Senate bill.",
            "He said in a floor speech, \u201cWe cannot hope to deter conflict without demonstrating resolve and investing seriously in American strength.\u201d",

            "The teen girl is charged as an adult, but The Associated Press is not naming her because of her age.
