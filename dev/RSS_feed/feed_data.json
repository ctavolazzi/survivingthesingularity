            "By\n                        \n              Caitlin Yilek",
            "Updated on:  April 15, 2024 / 8:38 PM EDT\n          / CBS News",
            "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday unveiled a proposal for sending wartime aid to Israel and Ukraine as he seeks to fend off a right-wing revolt that could put his leadership in peril.",
            "The Louisiana Republican said he plans to put four separate bills on the floor, separating aid for Israel with assistance for Ukraine, which has faced fierce pushback among some members of his conference. A third measure includes aid for Taiwan and the final bill addresses other Republican foreign policy demands.",
            "\"We won't be voting on the Senate supplemental in its current form, but we will vote on each of these measures separately in four different pieces,\" Johnson told reporters after meeting with House Republicans.",
            "The speaker said he hoped the bills' text would be released Tuesday, and he'd then honor a 72-hour rule that gives lawmakers time to read legislation before a vote and allow amendments. If the measures survive the House Rules Committee, votes could take place as soon as Friday.",
            "Johnson said they're still discussing whether to then merge the individual bills into one package before sending it to the Senate for approval, though his preference is to send them individually.",
            "Johnson has resisted pressure from defense hawks in both parties to bring up a $95 billion package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that passed the Senate in February with bipartisan support. Johnson has struggled to find a path forward amid fractures among Republicans and Democrats over emergency assistance to Ukraine and Israel. But Iran's drone-and-missile attack over the weekend on Israel, which came in retaliation for a strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month, increased the pressure on Johnson to hold a vote on the Senate bill this week. Proponents of the Senate bill believe it has enough support to pass the House.",
            "Putting Ukraine aid up for a vote carries the threat of ending his six-month tenure as speaker that has been defined by GOP infighting that has thrown the lower chamber into dysfunction. House Republicans' narrow majority has forced Johnson to repeatedly rely on Democrats to pass major legislation, much to the chagrin of some conservatives. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has threatened to trigger a vote on ousting Johnson if he moves ahead with an aid package for Ukraine.",
            "Greene called the proposal \"another wrong direction\" for Johnson, but said she hadn't decided on whether she'd move ahead in trying to oust him.",
            "\"I am firmly against the plan as it stands right now,\" Greene said after Monday's conference meeting. \"This is such a scam.\"",
            "When asked whether he could survive a vote to remove him, Johnson said, \"I don't spend my time worrying about motions to vacate. We're trying to govern here, and we're going to do our job. I'm not sure how that shakes out.\"",
            "Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who leads the Republican Study Committee, endorsed the plan, saying Johnson \"is doing the right thing.\"",
            "Earlier Monday, the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which supports aid to Israel, warned Johnson against using \"the emergency situation in Israel as a bogus justification to ram through Ukraine aid with no offset and no security for our own wide-open borders.\"",
            "While splitting the aid into individual bills may appease conservatives, it also makes passage in the Senate uncertain. The White House said Monday it opposes a standalone Israel bill.",
            "\"Wow, that sounds complicated,\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told reporters when told of Johnson's proposal.",
            "Meanwhile, some progressives oppose sending additional aid to Israel over its handling of the war in Gaza. A recent Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers for the World Central Kitchen could harden Democratic resistance.",
            "While he's put off consideration for Ukraine aid, Johnson has brought up Israel aid. In November, the House passed $14.3 billion in funding for Israel that would have been paid for by\u00a0cutting the same amount in funding to the IRS. The legislation never received a vote in the Senate because of Democratic opposition to the IRS cuts. Another vote in February on\u00a0a standalone bill\u00a0failed to meet the two-thirds threshold needed for passage.",
            "Lawmakers have also tried to bypass Johnson and force a vote on foreign aid. House Democrats tried to use a rarely successful legislative maneuver known as a discharge petition to force a vote on the Senate bill, but have so far fallen short of the 218 signatures needed. A competing effort from a bipartisan group of House members, which would force a vote on a smaller foreign aid bill, has far fewer backers.",
            "Scott MacFarlane and Alejandro Alvarez contributed reporting.",

            "From CNN's Jeremy Herb",
            "Donald Trump has been inside a half-dozen\u00a0courthouses\u00a0over the past year, but he had a new experience walking into a\u00a0downtown Manhattan courtroom Monday morning: a half-empty room.",
            "The former president\u00a0slowly walked through the cavernous and dingy courtroom, past six empty rows of benches \u2013 set aside for prospective jurors \u2013 giving a quick glance to the six reporters sitting in the back row before sauntering to the front of the room and taking his seat at the defense table.",
            "The\u00a0vacant\u00a0rows served as a reminder to Trump that he\u2019s in a different setting\u00a0now\u00a0that he\u2019s a criminal defendant for the first time. By the afternoon, the courtroom was packed full with 96 jurors \u2013 some of whom may be on the jury who will hear the hush money\u00a0trial\u00a0against the Republican presumptive presidential nominee.",
            "Trump only spoke three times during Monday\u2019s session, acknowledging to the judge he understood his rights as a criminal defendant. Throughout the day Trump often engaged with his attorneys, whispering to them and sharing notes as they debated motions with the Manhattan\u00a0District Attorney\u2019s Office.",
            "Trump also sat back at times and closed his eyes as\u00a0Judge Juan Merchan\u00a0slogged through the jury pool and asked\u00a0up to\u00a042 questions\u00a0of\u00a0each prospective juror.",
            "",
            "",
            "While Trump didn\u2019t have a platform\u00a0inside the courtroom, he didn\u2019t take long to make his feelings known\u00a0when\u00a0he left for the day, speaking to the camera right outside the courtroom after pulling out his iPhone from his suit pocket and handing it to an aide.",

            "",
            "The opening day of the first criminal trial of former President Donald Trump hit home the reality that the presumptive Republican nominee for president will be sitting in a Manhattan courtroom as a defendant four days a week.",
            "Here are the key takeaways from day one of \u201cThe People of the State of New York vs Donald Trump.\u201d",
            "The difficulty in picking a jury: Merchan brought in 96 New Yorkers as prospective jurors. More than half were quickly dismissed because they said they did not think they could be fair and impartial. Among the other nine potential jurors who were questioned, none said they had read any books written by either Trump or Michael Cohen. And none had said they\u2019d worked or volunteered for Trump.",
            "Defense wants to slow things down: Sources told CNN that there will likely be many objections and sidebars during the trial because the defense is completely focused on preserving every issue for appeal. These tactics fit the larger Trump legal strategy, which included months of appeals to delay the start of the trial, which was successful on separate grounds. The defense now hopes legal proceedings, which are expected to last six to eight weeks, move at a slow pace with the 2024 election just months away.",
            "",
            "",
            "Trump accused of violating gag order: Prosecutors asked Judge Juan Merchan to sanction Trump and fine him for violating the gag order prohibiting him from talking about witnesses in the case, the DA\u2019s office or court staff. Merchan scheduled a hearing on the district attorney\u2019s motion for next Tuesday.",
            "\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape can\u2019t be played, but actress can testify: Merchan sided with prosecutors in allowing Karen McDougal, an actress and model who alleged she also had an affair with Trump,\u00a0to testify. Prosecutors can also introduce National Enquirer stories slamming Trump\u2019s opponents as evidence. Trump has denied the affair. A key victory for Trump, meanwhile, was Merchan's ruling that the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape can\u2019t be played in court, saying it was prejudicial. Prosecutors also will not be allowed to bring up other sexual assault allegations against Trump that surfaced after the\u00a0\u201cAccess Hollywood tape\u201d\u00a0was made public in October 2016.",

            "It is one of\u00a0four criminal cases\u00a0Trump faces, while he also juggles being the Republican presumptive nominee for president. The former president is now facing at least\u00a088 charges\u00a0over the four criminal indictments in Georgia, New York, Washington, DC, and Florida.

            "Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.",
            "That means that prosecutors need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records with the intent to commit or conceal another crime \u2014 but they don\u2019t have to prove that Trump committed that crime.",
            "Prosecutors allege Trump was trying to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments that were made to influence the election outcome.\u00a0They also allege tax fraud, according to the indictment.",

As we continue to recover those who have perished, may we never forget them, their loved ones, and the commitment they made to work in a profession that bettered the lives of so many Marylanders across the state.\"",

Butler, Jr., Superintendent of the Maryland Department of State Police, \"Along with all of our allied law enforcement partners, we pledge to exhaust the physical and technical aspects of their training while deploying every available resource possible.\"",
            "Nearby at TradePoint Atlantic\u2014the only place near the Port of Baltimore where larger ships can currently dock\u2014cargo is getting unloaded including many new cars Monday. That keeps jobs in Baltimore.",
            "\"We're actually able to make sure this cargo stays in Baltimore because there are other ports that are interested in helping, but that also means that cargo could go permanently to a different port, so we are thankful to be able to help with some of that redirected cargo,\" said Kristin King of TradePoint Atlantic.",
            "Baltimore City is taking legal action against entities it deems responsible for the deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and the FBI has\u00a0opened an investigation\u00a0into the disaster.",
            "Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott on Monday announced the city partnered with two high-profile trial law firms to take legal action against those responsible for the tragedy, including the ship's owner, charterer, operator, manufacturer and other parties.",
            "The mayor said the effort is to mitigate the immediate and long-term harm caused to Baltimore's residents, like the families of the victims, workers in the Port of Baltimore, and those who used the bridge every day. It is not clear how much in damages the city seeks.",
            "\"We are continuing to do everything in our power to support everyone impacted here and will continue to recognize the human impact this event has had,\" the mayor said in a statement. \"Part of that work needs to be seeking recourse from those who may potentially be responsible, and with the ship's owner\u00a0filing a petition to limit its liability\u00a0mere days after the incident, we need to act equally as quickly to protect the City's interests.\"",

            "LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - Severe storms Monday evening, Monday night, and into Tuesday morning highlight the forecast as much of the 10/11 coverage area is under the threat for potential severe weather over the next 12 to 18 hours. Much of the area is covered by an enhanced risk for severe storms - meaning numerous severe storms will be possible across the area. This setup can be the most difficult to effectively keep the public informed and safe because much of the severe weather could be occurring during the overnight hours when people will be asleep. Make sure to have multiple ways to get your weather information tonight, and make sure that they can wake you to warn you in case of pending severe weather in your area! As of 9:30 PM, A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is in place for central Nebraska until midnight tonight. Tennis ball sized hail, 70 MPH wind gusts, and a tornado or two are possible in the watch area. A Tornado Watch is in place for south central Nebraska and northern Kansas until 3 AM Tuesday morning. Very large hail up to 3\u2033 in diameter, scattered wind gusts up to 75 MPH, and a couple tornadoes are possible within the Tornado Watch.",
            "The main threat with storms tonight for most will be large hail - up to 2\u2033 in diameter or larger - and damaging winds gusts. There is the potential though for several tornadoes, and potentially some strong tornadoes. The greatest threat for a few tornadoes will be across parts of central Nebraska, down into parts of northern Kansas. That said, Lincoln and eastern Nebraska can\u2019t rule out an isolated tornado or two during the overnight hours tonight.",
            "Much of the atmosphere is capped by warm air aloft, meaning that that storm initiation is going to hold off until late tonight and into the overnight hours as the low-level jet intensifies across the region. Initially, we\u2019re expected some isolated to scattered thunderstorm activity to be possible across parts of northern and central Nebraska along a surging warm front and an advancing dryline. Scattered elevated thunderstorms have been ongoing for parts of southeastern Nebraska, but as the night wears on, activity in parts of western and central Nebraska will push to the east as a line of strong to severe storms - it\u2019s this line that we\u2019re most concerned with for the Lincoln area as it most likely will be our greatest threat for severe weather overnight tonight. Eventually, storms will push east of the state on Tuesday morning as the surface low moves from west to east across the state. We\u2019ll see a lull in rain and storms and may even see sunny skies for a brief period late Tuesday morning into the afternoon. Chances for rain - not severe weather - will tick back up as the main low moves across eastern Nebraska by the late afternoon into the evening hours. Moisture with this second wave of rain isn\u2019t expected to be heavy.",
            "For Lincoln, the window for severe storms will be open from 10 PM Monday to about 10 AM Tuesday, with thunderstorm chances peaking at 90% through the morning commute on Tuesday.",
            "Rainfall amounts are forecast to be heaviest across northeastern parts of the state, where rain and thunderstorms are expected to wrap around the surface low. As much as 1.50\u2033 to 2.50\u2033 of moisture looks to be possible those areas. Lesser amounts are forecast for Lincoln and southeastern Nebraska, where 0.25\u2033 to 0.75\u2033 looks to be a general rule of thumb. That being said, locally higher amounts will be possible, especially for those areas that see heavy thunderstorms.",
            "All the meanwhile, windy conditions are expected tonight and through the day on Tuesday as the surface low tracks through the state. South and southeast winds will eventually turn more to the north and northwest as the low moves across the state, with gusts sustained at 15 to 30 MPH and wind gusts as high as 40 to 45 MPH possible.",
            "As far as temperatures are concerned, morning lows will range from the upper 40s in the west to the lower 60s in eastern Nebraska.",
            "Daytime high temperatures on Tuesday will be cooler than the last several days, with peak temperatures reaching the upper 50s to the low 70s across the coverage area.",
            "The extended forecast keeps temperatures around 70\u00b0 on Wednesday with more windy weather expected across the area. Another system is forecast to swing through the state Wednesday night into the day on Thursday which will bring clouds, rain chances, and cooler temperatures to the area. Look for highs falling to the low to mid 50s for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday before temperatures climb back to near normal by early next week.",

        "published": "Tue, 16 Apr 2024 02:06:00 GMT",
        "paragraphs": [
            "Earlier this month, a video posted to social media captured two men destroying ancient rock formations at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada. National park rangers are asking for the public\u2019s help in identifying the visitors, who could face federal charges for vandalizing protected land.",
            "In the footage from April 7, a man in a long-sleeve red shirt and another man in a black T-shirt stand atop a rock formation at Redstone Trail, one of the protected site\u2019s most popular hiking trails. In the video, the pair dislodges and shoves boulders over the edge while a frightened girl screams and pleads with her father to not fall. The sandstone chunks crumble on their descent, millions of years of geologic history pulverized in seconds.",
            "\u201cThese aren\u2019t just rocks. They\u2019re ancient resources. They were formed millions of years ago,\u201d said Neal Desai, senior program director for the Pacific region of the National Parks Conservation Association. \u201cThat\u2019s why we as a country have set them aside and have ensured that they will be equally owned by all of us forever.\u201d",
            "On social media, Lake Mead officials shared incriminating images of the perpetrators defacing the rocks and requested information about the pair. Authorities are accusing the men of vandalism, which the National Park Service describes as \u201can act of cultural violence.\u201d It is also illegal.",
            "An NPS spokesman said law enforcement rangers are investigating the case. The penalty depends on the type of damage and level of severity, and can range from a misdemeanor to a felony.",
            "John Haynes, the recreation area\u2019s public information officer, told Fox 5 KVVU-TV the vandals could face six months of jail time and a $5,000 fine. Lake Mead officials did not respond to a request for information.",
            "The agency urges anyone who witnesses an illegal or irresponsible act on protected public land to take a video or photos of the infraction. They can anonymously share the information through the NPS tips line (888-653-0009), an online form or via email (nps_isb@nps.gov).",
            "Desai said the majority of visitors respect the sanctity of national park sites, but a few bad apples do roll through every so often.",
            "According to NPS\u2019s Investigative Services, visitors attempted to break into the Mission San Jos\u00e9, part of the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, last June and damaged the church\u2019s baroque Rose Window. In May 2022, park rangers sought help from the public to recover reptile track fossils stolen years before from Capitol Reef National Park in Utah.",
            "State parks are equally vulnerable to vandalism. In 2013, three men leading a Boy Scout outing in Utah\u2019s Goblin Valley State Park pushed a boulder off its spindly rock pedestal. Two of the culprits were initially charged with third-degree felonies but pleaded guilty to misdemeanors.",
            "According to the NPS,  nearly 5.8 million people visited Lake Mead last year. The 1.5-million-acre natural playground features the largest reservoir on the Colorado River and a trove of geologic features sculpted over millions of years.",
            "\u201cGeologically, it\u2019s really interesting because it has rocks spanning from really old \u2014 480 million-year-old sand dunes \u2014 to much more recent volcanic rocks that are 5 to 7 million years old,\u201d said Matthew Lachniet, a geology professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.",
            "Lachniet said the defiled rocks originated from the Aztec sandstone unit that dates from the early Jurassic period. The rocks are roughly 180 million years old, and the formations are younger \u2014 only a couple million years old.",
            "Though common in the Southwest, he said, the red sandstone is unique to desert environments. Over time, the confluence of rain, frost and erosion shapes the rock into castle-like spires, delicate arches and sculptural shapes with peek-a-boo holes. These formations are typically weaker and easier to break, but they would not have shattered without human intervention.",
            "\u201cThey would have slowly disintegrated away, sand grain by sand grain, over hundreds of thousands to millions of years,\u201d Lachniet said.",
            "The destruction of the rocks will permanently alter Lake Mead\u2019s distinctive landscape, one of the primary reasons the recreation area was established in 1964. Park officials can\u2019t patch up the fallen rocks and perch them back on their original site. Once people intervene, the attraction is no longer a product made by Mother Nature.",
            "\u201cIf you restore it, then it becomes anthropogenic. It is art rather than something natural,\u201d said Elizabeth Cottrell, a geologist at Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t invoke the same wonder and awe of nature.\u201d",
            "How we travel now: More people are taking booze-free trips \u2014 and airlines and hotels are taking note. Some couples are ditching the traditional honeymoon for a \u201cbuddymoon\u201d with their pals. Interested? Here are the best tools for making a group trip work.",
            "Bad behavior: Entitled tourists are running amok, defacing the Colosseum, getting rowdy in Bali and messing with wild animals in national parks. Some destinations are fighting back with public awareness campaigns \u2014 or just by telling out-of-control visitors to stay away.",
            "Safety concerns: A door blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 jet, leaving passengers traumatized \u2014 but without serious injuries. The ordeal led to widespread flight cancellations after the jet was grounded, and some travelers have taken steps to avoid the plane in the future. The incident has also sparked a fresh discussion about whether it\u2019s safe to fly with a baby on your lap."

            "President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and his wife, Jill, on Monday released tax returns showing that their income rose 7% to $619,976 in 2023 and that the couple paid 23.7% of their income in federal taxes.",
            "Biden released the data on the day U.S. taxes for the prior year are due and as the Democrat\u00a0seeks re-election in 2024.",
            "Donald Trump, his Republican opponent, broke with the tradition of presidents making their federal tax returns public, saying he was not able to do so while being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, even as the agency claimed he was free to release them.",
            "A House committee controlled in 2022 by Democrats released\u00a0Trump\u2019s redacted returns\u00a0for 2015 through 2020 over the former president\u2019s objections.",
            "Trump was in a New York courtroom on Monday for\u00a0a historic criminal trial, one of several legal matters that has implicated the ex-president\u2019s personal finances.",
            "\u201cPresident Biden believes that all occupants of the Oval Office should be open and honest with the American people, and that the longstanding tradition of annually releasing presidential tax returns should continue unbroken,\u201d the White House said in a statement.",
            "Trump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
            "In a post on social media on Monday, Trump said American families benefited from tax cuts passed while he was in office. He said if Biden \u201cgets his way\u201d people would be facing \u201ccolossal\u201d tax increases. He included no information about his 2023 tax filing.",
            "Biden and his wife earned four-fifths of their income from their jobs as U.S. president and teacher at Northern Virginia Community College, respectively. Joe Biden drew a $400,000 wage, while Jill Biden earned $85,985 from her job teaching English at Northern Virginia Community College.",
            "The additional income was drawn from interest on investments, pensions and a corporate entity that collects the couple\u2019s book royalties. Most of the increase of income relative to 2022 was from interest paid on one of the couple\u2019s bank accounts, according to the tax return.",
            "The proportion of Joe Biden\u2019s income that went to federal taxes was roughly equal to the prior year.",
            "Biden plans to deliver a speech on tax policy from his Scranton, Pennsylvania, birthplace on Tuesday that is expected to include a call for the wealthy to pay higher rates. Pennsylvania is expected to be one of the most closely contested 2024 election states in November.",
            "The president\u2019s return also showed that Biden donated $20,477 to charity, roughly 3.3% of their income, with the beneficiaries including several churches and public health groups like the Epilepsy Foundation and the Fraternal Order of Police.",
            "Biden\u2019s running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, also released a tax return showing $450,380 income for 2023, federal taxes of $88,570 and charitable donations of $23,026.",

            "For more than two years, Ukraine has faced Russian missile and drone attacks, often including Iranian-made Shahed drones like the ones Tehran used on Saturday. As a shield, Ukraine relies on a hodgepodge of air defense systems provided by Western partners, including three U.S.-designed Patriot batteries manned by Ukrainian troops. This month, the biggest power station serving Kyiv was destroyed. Civilian casualties are common.",
            "By contrast, as the weapons launched from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen advanced toward their targets in Israel this weekend, U.S. forces prepared to react with fighter jets, a Patriot battery in Iraq and U.S. destroyers. Britain, France and Jordan also stepped up to assist. Together with Israel\u2019s Iron Dome air defense system, they knocked down 99 percent of the roughly 300 missiles and drones \u2014 averting major damage.",
            "The discrepancy in response was not lost on observers in Ukraine.",
            "Last week alone, Russia launched nearly 130 Shahed drones, 80 missiles and 700 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Sunday. Ukraine relied on its own troops and its dwindling supplies of ammunition. But the immediate international response to Iran\u2019s attack on Israel proved that modern air defense can save lives and that such defense is possible, Zelensky said.",
            "\u201cThe whole world saw that Israel was not alone in this defense \u2014 the threat in the sky was also being eliminated by its allies,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cAnd when Ukraine says that its allies should not turn a blind eye to Russian missiles and drones, it means action is needed \u2014 a bold one.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is not rhetoric that protects the sky, it is not opinions that curb the production of missiles and drones for terror,\u201d he added.",
            "But with a $60 billion aid package stalled in Congress, Ukraine is urgently running out of ammunition and other supplies needed to keep up its own defense against airstrikes.",
            "Like Zelensky, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba referred to the direct help that partners provided to Israel. \u201cEven if you cannot act the way you act in Israel, give us what we need and we will do the rest of the job,\u201d Kuleba said.",
            "Fearful that direct conflict with Russia could escalate into nuclear war, the United States and other NATO countries repeatedly have dismissed the idea of direct troop involvement in Ukraine. When French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that sending soldiers should not be ruled out, other Western leaders quickly denounced the suggestion as dangerous.",
            "Ukrainian officials say they need 26 Patriot systems, which each cost more than $1 billion, to cover the entire country.",
            "British Foreign Secretary David Cameron told British radio station LBC that partners need to support Ukraine financially, diplomatically and with weapons deliveries \u201cto defend themselves\u201d in addition to troop training.",
            "To engage \u201cNATO forces directly in conflict with Russian forces, I think that would be a dangerous escalation,\u201d he said.",
            "Speaking to reporters Monday, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that President Biden had made it clear that the United States would not take on a combat role in Ukraine.",
            "\u201cDifferent conflicts, different airspace, different threat picture,\u201d Kirby said.",
            "Kuleba has recently ramped up his pressure on Ukraine\u2019s supporters to try to secure them. So far, only Germany has agreed, announcing on Saturday that it will send one Patriot to Ukraine.",
            "Some Ukrainians expressed hope that the largely thwarted attack on Israel would spur action on Capitol Hill, where the aid for Ukraine could be tied to further support for Israel.",
            "And Ukrainian officials were not the only ones drawing comparisons to the Middle East.",
            "Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, posting on X, formerly Twitter, commended Israel for repelling the attack. \u201cNow it would be useful to strengthen Israel\u2019s antimissile defense and equip Ukraine with similar systems,\u201d Sikorski wrote. \u201cThe easiest way is to unlock the aid package for Ukraine and Israel.\u201d",
            "In a new report on Monday, the Institute for the Study of War noted that Israel\u2019s successful defense against Iran\u2019s attack \u201cunderscores the vulnerabilities that Ukrainian geography and the continued degradation of Ukraine\u2019s air defense umbrella pose for Ukrainian efforts to defend against regular Russian missile and drone strikes.\u201d",
            "Ukraine\u2019s geographic proximity to Russia also poses a challenge, with missiles and drones often traveling only short distances to reach their targets, giving Ukraine just minutes to react. By comparison, Israel and its partners had several hours to prepare for the weekend strikes, the ISW report said.",
            "In Ukraine, others described the disadvantage more bluntly.",
            "Celebrated Ukrainian novelist Oksana Zabuzhko wrote on Facebook that Israel faced an opponent \u201cbefore whom the West does not fall on its back in a position of canine humility.\u201d In Jordan, she noted, Israel also had a neighbor who assisted in stopping the strikes.",
            "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any of that,\u201d she wrote. (In February 2022, Belarus, Ukraine\u2019s neighbor, allowed Russian troops to cross its territory.)",
            "Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Osadchuk wrote on Facebook that \u201cif suddenly the air force of NATO countries want to shoot down Iranian drones in the sky of Israel more effectively, they can train for free in Ukraine.\u201d",
            "Others said the multinational defense of Israel showed Ukraine to be isolated.",
            "\u201cWhat conclusion should Ukraine draw? We can only count on ourselves,\u201d Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko wrote on Telegram. Iran said the attack on Israel was in self-defense, he wrote. \u201cHave we heard this before?\u201d he wrote, referencing Russia\u2019s excuses for invading Ukraine.",
            "Russia also responded to Iran\u2019s strikes, by calling for restraint.",
            "\u201cThe situation in the Middle East has become as heated as it may get and the conflict risks escalating to a regionwide confrontation,\u201d Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, said a Security Council meeting on Monday. \u201cThe spiral of confrontation and bloodshed must stop.\u201d",
            "Speaking of the Iranian strikes on Sunday morning, Nebenzya reminded the audience about the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, which preceded Iran\u2019s attack on Israel. Nebenzya criticized certain members of the Security Council for their reluctance to clearly condemn the Israeli airstrike in the Syrian capital.",
            "\u201cThe parade of hypocrisy and double standards that is unfolding in the Security Council today is so gross,\u201d he said, referring to the West\u2019s readiness to criticize Iran but not Israel.",
            "Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said that the successful defense of Israel showed the need for a \u201cmandatory hard power response\u201d to such attacks.",
            "\u201c'Answer or die!' \u2014 should be the unequivocal rule against those who seek to destroy global stability,\u201d Podolyak posted on X.",

            "Boeing employees walk the new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner down towards the delivery ramp area at the company's facility after conducting its first test flight at Charleston International Airport in 2017. A Senate subcommittee has opened an investigation into the safety of Boeing jetliners, intensifying safety concerns about the company's aircraft.",
            "Boeing is defending the integrity of the fuselages on two of its largest planes, which have come under criticism from a whistleblower who warns that panels on the outside of one of the planes could eventually break apart during flight.",
            "Two Boeing engineering executives went into detail Monday to describe how panels are fitted together, particularly on the 787 Dreamliner. They suggested the 787's carbon-composite skin is nearly impervious to metal fatigue that weakens conventional aluminum fuselages.",
            "Their comments during a lengthy media briefing served as both a response to news reports last week about the whistleblower's allegations and a preemptive strike before he testifies to a congressional panel on Wednesday.",
            "The whistleblower, Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, said excessive force was applied to fit panels together on the 787 assembly line, raising the risk of fatigue, or microscopic cracking in the material that could cause it break apart.",
            "The Boeing officials described how sections of a fuselage are brought together, shims are added to fill gaps, holes are drilled and cleaned, and fasteners attached to apply \"pull-up force\" that 99% of the time results in margins no greater than .005 inches (0.127 millimeters) apart \u2014 the width of a human hair, they said. A gap problem was discovered in 2019 between two panels, which led to design and assembly changes, they said.",
            "Boeing conducted testing replicating 165,000 flights with no findings of fatigue in the composite structure, Steve Chisholm, Boeing's vice president of structural engineering, said. The average 787 makes 600 flights a year, he said.",
            "The company said planes already in use are proving safe. Chisholm said 671 Dreamliners have undergone the intensive inspections for 6-year-old planes and eight have undergone 12-year inspections with no evidence of fatigue in the composite skins.",
            "Cracks have been found on metallic parts, including a piece above where the wings join the fuselage, and Boeing issued inspection guidelines for those parts, the officials said.",
            "The 787 Dreamliner is a two-aisle plane that has often been used on international flights since its debut in 2011. The composite material makes the plane lighter, contributing to better fuel efficiency.",
            "A series of battery fires briefly grounded the planes. Deliveries of the aircraft have been stopped at times because of questions about gaps between fuselage panels that were wider than Boeing's standards allowed, the use of unapproved titanium parts from a supplier in Italy, and flaws in a pressure bulkhead.",
            "The Federal Aviation Administration must inspect and approve each 787 that rolls off the assembly line before it can be flown to an airline customer.",
            "The whistleblower Salehpour claims that after he raised safety concerns about the 787, Boeing transferred him to work on an older widebody plane, the 777. He told the Seattle Times that he saw workers jumping on fuselage panels to get them in alignment, which Boeing disputes.",
            "The New York Times reported that the FAA is investigating Salehpour's claims. The FAA, while not commenting specifically on Salehpour, said it investigates all safety reports.",
            "Boeing says it is \"fully confident\" in both planes.",
            "Salehpour is the latest in a line of Boeing whistleblowers to come forward, often alleging retaliation for raising safety concerns. The company said it encourages employees to speak up about problems.",
            "Lisa Fahl, the vice president of engineering for Boeing airplane programs, said employee reports have \"exploded\" \u2014 with as many reports in January and February as were filed in all of 2023 \u2014 \"which is what we want.\"",

            "Shares of Truth Social parent company have fallen 60% since March market debut as ex-president under financial pressure",
            "Shares of the former president Donald Trump\u2019s social media company slumped 12% on Monday, extending their string of losses, after the company said in a regulatory filing that it could sell millions of additional shares in coming months.",
            "The filing showed a potential sale of 146.1m shares in Trump Media & Technology Group, including 114.8m shares owned by Trump himself. Documents also listed an additional 21.5m shares that could be sold upon the exercise of certain warrants issued when the company went public through a blank-check merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp.",
            "Shares of the Truth Social parent company have retreated sharply since their market debut on 26 March, falling 60% from the opening price of $70.90. Trump is subject to a lockup agreement that prevents him from personally selling his shares until September, further tying his wealth to the company\u2019s market value. If the price holds, he could reap billions of dollars from his shares.",
            "Trump, the presumed Republican 2024 nominee, started his criminal trial on Monday in a Manhattan court as the stock dipped. He is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. It is the first criminal trial of an American president, and the proceedings are expected to last about six weeks.",
            "Trump is under significant financial pressure after a series of legal woes in the past year. He owes about $500m as a result of being found liable in civil fraud, defamation and sexual abuse cases. Trump Media, which was backed by some of the former president\u2019s biggest political donors, has offered him a future lifeline and source of income to pay off those debts.",
            "Sign up to Trump on Trial",
            "Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials. Guardian staff will send weekly updates each Wednesday \u2013 as well as bonus editions on major trial days.",
            "after newsletter promotion",
            "Earlier this month, several Democratic-aligned groups called on Congress to investigate Trump Media amid a flurry of news about the firm\u2019s dubious hangers-on. Two Florida brothers pleaded guilty at the beginning of April to insider trading related to the ex-president\u2019s social media company. Meanwhile, the Guardian reported that the company was kept afloat by loans from a Russian-American businessman who is under federal investigation for money laundering and insider trading."

            "Adobe\u2019s generative artificial intelligence flagship is Firefly, a text-to-image tool that powers generative fill-in for Photoshop and text-to-vector in Illustrator. However, the 2024 Firefly model will power three AI video tools inside video editing software Premiere Pro: Generative Extend, Object Addition and Removal, and Text to Video.",
            "Premiere already allows video editors to integrate Adobe creative cloud software like After Effects (motion graphics) and Audition (sound mixing). Today\u2019s announcement makes clear that Adobe will take the same approach with AI. The company also announced that it is in \u201cearly explorations\u201d to integrate video generation from OpenAI (Sora), Runway, and Pika Labs into Premiere.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories 4 Years (and Judicious Editing) Later, Quibi Series \u2018The Stranger\u2019 Has Become a Movie \u2018The Holdovers,\u2019 \u2018Succession,\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Win Top Prizes at WGA Awards (Complete Winners List)",
            "Last week, Adobe demonstrated these new gen AI tools for IndieWire and shared examples (see video at the top of the page) of what will be available inside Premiere Pro before the end of the year.",
            "Every editor has wished for just a few more frames to allow for a smoother edit or transition. The Gen Extend tool would allow editors to use AI to create new frames of up to a \u201cfew seconds\u201d that Adobe promises will \u201cseamlessly add frames to make clips longer.\u201d",
            "In the preview video, the tool extends the actress\u2019 stoic performance by a couple of seconds to fill a gap in the editor\u2019s timeline. While extending performance introduces ethical and union issues, filmmakers have long used VFX tricks to blend footage to buy some extra frames. This tool could let editors create real-time solutions inside Premiere.",
            "Adding and removing objects from frame often involves painstaking VFX work, but the Firefly tool would allow an editor to do it in real time. The key will be if gen AI can maintain photorealism. The examples offered in Adobe\u2019s preview (adding a stack of diamonds to the briefcase and removing an electrical box from frame) appear photoreal, maintaining image and lighting consistency. Both in its press release and in a briefing with IndieWire, Adobe insisted that these pixels were generated by the upcoming Firefly video model without further manipulation.",
            "Early results look promising, but until editors test drive it on a wide range of footage we won\u2019t know how applicable these tools will be in the near future.",
            "Firefly is not new in terms of the ability to use text-to-video tools to create shots. What\u2019s fascinating is Adobe will give filmmakers the ability to access text to video from inside Premiere, and will include Firefly competitors Sora, Runway, and Pika Labs. It\u2019s clear Adobe anticipates editors utilizing these tools in their daily workflows.",
            "Many gen AI image and video models are built on copyrighted material. In an embarrassing interview, OpenAI Sora\u2019s CTO couldn\u2019t even answer straightforward questions about what trained its generative video model.",
            "However, filmmakers have praised Adobe for using only licensed images to train Firefly. Adobe executives confirmed to IndieWire that the soon-to-be-released Firefly video model will continue abiding by these same rules.",
            "It\u2019s curious, then, that Adobe will integrate third-party AI companies that are far less ethical regarding copyright. However, Adobe said it will continue its use of content credentials.",
            "\u201cAs one of the founders of the Content Authenticity Initiative, Adobe pledges to attach Content Credentials \u2014 free, open-source technology that serves as a nutrition label for online content \u2014 to assets produced within its applications so users can see how content was made and what AI models were used to generate the content created on Adobe platforms,\u201d reads today\u2019s press release.",
            "The permanence of these nutrition labels \u2014 and how easily they can be peeled off the jar \u2014 remains to be seen.",
            "In May, Premiere\u2019s audio workflow will get an upgraded set of tools, some of which are AI powered and have been available in beta for a while. These include:",

            "Global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% to 289.4 million units during January-March, with Samsung, at 20.8% market share, clinching the top phonemaker spot from Apple.",

Joel was singing the final verse of \u201cPiano Man\u201d when the screen went black and then cut to local newscasts.",

            "\u201cI had a goal to be here tonight and give my family a better life, so I\u2019m just so thankful that I was able to be here,\u201d she told ESPN through tears.",
            "UConn\u2019s Aaliyah Edwards went sixth overall to the Washington Mystics. Reese, meanwhile, landed with the Sky at No. 7, joining forces with fellow rookie Cardoso. Reese was the 2023 Final Four Most Outstanding Player when LSU won the national title, with Cardoso earning the honor this year after South Carolina completed an undefeated season and won the program\u2019s third national championship.",
            "\u201cComing back (to LSU) would have been amazing for me, but I wanted more for myself,\u201d Reese said. \u201cI wanted to start over. I feel like I had been on a high since (winning) the national championship, and I want to hit rock bottom.",
            "\u201cI want to be a rookie again. I want to be knocked down by vets, and I want to be able to get up and grow and be a sponge. I\u2019m just super excited to play with the amazing players and against amazing players.\u201d",
            "Utah\u2019s Alissa Pili went to the Minnesota Lynx at No. 8. Two players from France completed the top 10: The Wings selected Carla Leite at No. 9, and the Connecticut Sun with the 10th pick chose Leila Lacan.",
            "The crowd roared for the hometown New York Liberty\u2019s pick, going with Marquesha Davis of Ole Miss at No. 11. To complete the first round, the Atlanta Dream selected Australian Nyadiew Puoch with the 12th pick.",
            "The buzz around Clark, who will be paired with last year\u2019s No. 1 overall pick, Aliyah Boston, comes with weighty expectations \u2013 and potential for more national audiences. On Wednesday, the WNBA announced 36 of the Fever\u2019s 40 games will be featured by the WNBA\u2019s national broadcast and streaming partners.",
            "\u201cCaitlin is one of the most naturally gifted basketball players I have ever seen enter the WNBA from the college level,\u201d Fever head coach Christie Sides said. \u201cHer shooting and passing abilities captivated an entire audience of basketball fans, and her ability to make those around her better was even more evident during her collegiate career. We can\u2019t wait to bring her to Indiana and incorporate her into our locker room with a group ready to get back to the postseason.\u201d",
            "The Fever had one of the worst records in the league last season, but with a tandem of Boston and Clark, it could be one of the hottest tickets in sports.",
            "\u201cI certainly know the pressure is there. I\u2019m aware of it,\u201d Clark told CNN on the Orange Carpet ahead of the draft. \u201cThere\u2019s never any running away from it. But I think for myself, all my confidence comes from the work I put in, comes from my teammates. I know this is a team sport; that\u2019s why I love basketball. It\u2019s not an individual sport and that\u2019s where all my confidence comes from. That\u2019s always what I rely on when moments feel tense or things feel under pressure. It\u2019s like that\u2019s what I just fall back to.\u201d",
            "Clark is not the only reason why interest in the sport has grown. Far from it.",
            "In the regular season and NCAA tournament, there were several college stars who delivered on the big stage \u2013 like Cardoso, Reese and Brink.",
            "Meanwhile, the WNBA has been full of stars since the league\u2019s inception. That hasn\u2019t changed as the league enters its 28th season.",
            "Related article\nWomen\u2019s college basketball: How Caitlin Clark rewrote the rules",
            "But a big difference in recent years at the professional and college level is how much more accessible they are to watch (and the amount of media coverage they get).",
            "\u201cI know people keep saying it\u2019s a historic draft class, but I think we need to look back at the draft class(es) before us as well because they\u2019re the women we grew up watching,\u201d Brink told CNN on the Orange Carpet. \u201cSo, we do it for them. They are the trailblazers and while this draft class is amazing and I could not be more proud of us, it\u2019s the women before us who have really been doing it.\u201d",
            "Tickets for Monday\u2019s WNBA draft sold out in less than 30 minutes.",
            "Ahead of Monday\u2019s draft, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the league\u2019s goal is to expand to 16 teams and said she is \u201cpretty confident\u201d that could happen by 2028. Currently at 12 teams, the league will expand to 13 in 2025 with a team being added in the San Francisco Bay Area.",
            "In 2023, the WNBA had its most-watched regular season in 21 years, and the season-ending WNBA Finals was the most-viewed Finals in 20 years. WNBA attendance was up 16% for the 2023 season compared to 2022.",
            "\u201cI love where the game is going right now and I just want to be a part of the growth,\u201d Reese told CNN on the Orange Carpet. \u201cWhatever happens, I just want to be a part of it.\u201d",
            "Meanwhile, the\u00a0NCAA women\u2019s tournament title game between South Carolina and Iowa drew nearly\u00a019 million average viewers, shattering records to become the most-watched women\u2019s college basketball game ever measured by Nielsen.",
            "The game not only eclipsed the men\u2019s final between Purdue and UConn by more than four million viewers, but it was also the most-viewed basketball game of the past five years, outpacing any NBA contest during that period, according to Nielsen.",
            "After last year\u2019s heartbreaking national championship game defeat, Clark\u2019s last dance with the Hawkeyes almost ended in fairytale fashion.",
            "Although Iowa eventually fell at the final hurdle again \u2013 this time at the hands of undefeated South Carolina \u2013 Clark\u2019s 2023-24 campaign highlighted the impact she\u2019s had on\u00a0women\u2019s basketball through her popularity and skillset.",
            "She became the all-time leading scorer in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s Division I college basketball during the past season, was named\u00a0Naismith Player of the Year\u00a0for the second consecutive season and had been named to the USA Basketball Women\u2019s National Team\u2019s 14-player training camp roster, perhaps paving the way for an Olympics appearance at\u00a0Paris 2024. However, Clark was unable to participate because it was held the same week as the Final Four.",
            "And now, with Clark in the WNBA, that excitement has been pushed forward to what she could achieve in the pros.",
            "Will Clark\u2019s game at the professional level translate to rising interest? Signs point that way. But other players make that happen, too.",

            "Mark Pope has some significant work to do to rebuild Kentucky's roster.",
            "Freshman point guard D.J. Wagner entered the transfer portal Monday, according to multiple reports, continuing an exodus of five-star talent from Lexington in the aftermath of head coach John Calipari's departure for Arkansas.",
            "Later Monday, Zvonimir Ivis\u030cic\u0301 announced on Instagram that he was leaving Kentucky to follow Calipari to Arkansas. A 7-foot-2 freshman, the Croatian center with NBA upside initially entered his name in the transfer portal over the weekend.",
            "Wagner joined the Wildcats last season as a McDonald's All American and top-10 recruit. He was projected as a potential one-and-done prospect, but will likely remain in college after a disappointing freshman campaign failed to cement his status as an NBA prospect.",
            "He was the latest Wildcat to enter the transfer portal alongside a handful of incoming freshmen who have re-opened their recruitment. Freshman forward Aaron Bradshaw \u2014 a fellow five-star recruit and Wagner's high school teammate \u2014 previously entered the transfer portal and committed to Ohio State.",
            "Ivis\u030cic\u0301 made his announcement after meeting earlier Monday with Pope, who was introduced as Kentucky's new head coach on Sunday.",
            "\"Today I met with Coach Pope and had a great meeting with him,\" Ivis\u030cic\u0301 wrote. \"He\u2019s an amazing guy and a great coach and he will do big things here! After our conversation I informed him that I will not be returning to Kentucky. ...",
            "\"I made the lifetime decision to come to college for few reasons. Main ones to win a national championship and go to the NBA. Monumental part of that decision was coach Cal, and no one does both of those at the same time than him. That's why I am excited to announce that I am committing to coach Cal and Arkansas Razorbacks!\"",
            "Wagner, Bradshaw and Ivis\u030cic\u0301 were a significant part of Calipari's top-ranked 2023 recruiting class that projects to lose two other players to the NBA. Fellow freshman Rob Dillingham has declared for the NBA Draft while Reed Sheppard \u2014 a projected lottery pick \u2014 has yet to make a decision.",
            "Meanwhile, four incoming freshmen have reportedly re-opened their recruitment since Calipari's departure. Somto Cyril, Karter Knox, Boogie Fland and Jayden Quaintance have all reportedly de-committed from Kentucky in the past week. Fland, Knox and Quaintance are all five-star prospects, according to Rivals. Cyril is a four-star prospect.",
            "The news of Ivis\u030cic\u0301's transfer and Wagner's expected departure arrives a day after Pope was officially introduced as Kentucky's head coach. The former BYU coach who played at Kentucky and captained its 1996 national championship team was greeted by thousands of Wildcats fans at a raucous introductory news conference at Rupp Arena on Sunday. His first order of business will be to retool a Kentucky roster that has significantly less talent than it did this time last week.",
            "Mark Pope wasn't Kentucky's first choice. But for the fans packing the stands at Rupp Arena Sunday, he was the right choice.",
            "Pope spent the past five seasons as head coach at BYU.",
            "Calipari posted a video Tuesday announcing his decision, but didn't indicate his next move. On Sunday, multiple outlets reported Calipari was in \"serious talks\" to become Arkansas' next head coach.",
            "Drew is the winningest coach in Baylor program history.",
            "The Wildcats were eliminated from the first round of the NCAA tournament for the second time in three seasons on Thursday.",
            "Here are five franchises who stood out, for better or for worse.",
            "The excitement is palpable as Clark prepares to use her passing and playmaking to help Indiana return to the postseason.",
            "Engelbert said Philadelphia, Toronto, Denver, Nashville and South Florida are potential expansion spots.",
            "Sterling has called Yankees games since 1989, a span including the Derek Jeter era that saw the franchise win five World Series championships.",

            "NAPLES, Fla. \u2014 NASA confirmed Monday that a mystery object that\u00a0crashed through the roof\u00a0of a Florida home last month was a chunk of space junk from equipment discarded at the International Space Station.",
            "The cylindrical object that tore through the home in Naples on March 8 was subsequently taken to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral for analysis.",
            "The space agency said it was a metal support\u00a0used to mount old batteries on a cargo pallet for disposal.",
            "The pallet was jettisoned from the space station in 2021, and the load was expected to eventually fully burn up on entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, but one piece survived.",
            "The chunk of metal weighed 1.6 pounds (0.7 kilograms) and was 4 inches (10 centimeters) tall and roughly 1 1/2 inches (4 centimeters) wide.",
            "Homeowner Alejandro Otero\u00a0told\u00a0television station WINK at the time that he was on vacation when his son told him what had happened.",
            "Otero came home early to check on the house, finding the object had ripped through his ceiling and torn up the flooring.",
            "\u201cI was shaking. I was completely in disbelief. What are the chances of something landing on my house with such force to cause so much damage,\u201d Otero said. \u201cI\u2019m super grateful that nobody got hurt.\u201d"

            "As the Moon blotted out the Sun to viewers across the United States during the April 8 solar eclipse, NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) captured an image from some 223,000 miles away of the highly anticipated celestial event.",
            "There are three cameras that comprise the LRO camera (LROC) suite: two Narrow Angle Cameras (NAC) and one Wide Angle Camera. The Earth\u2019s image with the shadow in it was acquired by one of the two Narrow Angle Cameras.",
            "The LROC Narrow Angle Cameras are line scanner cameras: they only have one line of pixels, and images are built up line-by-line by the spacecraft\u2019s motion as it orbits the Moon.",
            "Acquiring an image of Earth requires the spacecraft to rapidly rotate to build up the image.",
            "LRO is managed by\u00a0NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center\u00a0in Greenbelt, Maryland, for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Launched on June 18, 2009, LRO has collected a treasure trove of data with its seven powerful instruments, making an invaluable contribution to our knowledge about the Moon. NASA is returning to the Moon with commercial and international partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new knowledge and opportunities.",

            "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Sleep, But Better newsletter series.\u00a0Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.",
            "Makers of melatonin supplements have 18 to 24 months to voluntarily add child-deterrent packaging and improve cautionary language on labels of over-the-counter products, according to the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the leading trade association for the dietary supplement and functional food industry.",
            "Melatonin\u00a0is a\u00a0hormone\u00a0produced by the brain in response to darkness. It regulates the body\u2019s natural sleep-wake\u00a0cycle or circadian rhythm. As a dietary supplement, melatonin is not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, yet the demand for melatonin among both adults and children has skyrocketed over the last decade, according to experts.",
            "Related article\nUsing melatonin for sleep is on the rise, study says, despite potential health harms",
            "The council\u2019s action follows recent reports of a massive rise in accidental ingestions of melatonin by children and an April 2023 study that found 25 products labeled as melatonin gummies contained dangerous levels of the hormone. One over-the-counter product contained up to 347% more melatonin than listed on the label, while another contained no melatonin at all \u2014 it was entirely composed of cannabidiol or CBD.",
            "\u201cWhat\u2019s significant here is that the industry recognizes that melatonin supplements do pose serious risks \u2014 particularly to children\u2014 and that the industry\u00a0needs to do a much better job at ensuring the products are safe and well-manufactured,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Somerville, Massachusetts, who authored the study on melatonin gummies.",
            "\u201cWhether this voluntary recommendation will be followed, is another\u00a0matter entirely, and we\u2019ll need to see,\u201d Cohen said in an email.",
            "A March 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discovered some 11,000 children had been seen in emergency rooms between 2019 and 2022 after ingesting melatonin while unsupervised. Melatonin gummies were involved in nearly 5,000 of those cases.",
            "Related article\nOpinion: You might want to rethink taking melatonin as a sleep aid",
            "More than half of accidental ingestions involved children between 3 and 5 years old, and the majority of visits did not involve additional medications other than the melatonin, the CDC said.",
            "About three-quarters of the documented cases involved bottles \u2014 suggesting that young children were able to open the bottles or that the bottles were not closed properly. While the vast majority of unsupervised melatonin ingestions did not result in hospitalization, the number of accidental ingestions by children 5 and under may be underestimated, the report said.",
            "Some melatonin gummies state on the label that they also contain CBD, even though it\u2019s \u201ccurrently illegal to market CBD by adding it to a food or labeling it as a dietary supplement,\u201d according to the\u00a0US Food and Drug Administration.",
            "According to Cohen, four of the gummies he tested contained levels of CBD that were between 4% and 18% higher than on the label.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s no data that supports the use of CBD in children,\u201d Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor of pediatrics at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN previously. \u201cIt\u2019s currently only recommended for a very specific use in children over 1 (year old) with intractable seizure disorders.\u201d",
            "Aside from CBD, consuming a gummy that unknowingly contains extremely high levels of melatonin \u2014 well over the daily 0.5 milligram to 1 milligram per night that has been shown to induce sleep in kids \u2014 is also dangerous, Breuner said.",
            "Any discrepancies in melatonin ingredients or strength \u201ccould pose additional risk\u201d to children, the CDC researchers wrote in their April report.",
            "The council guidelines call for new labels that warn consumers about the danger of drowsiness after taking a melatonin supplement. Labels should also state that melatonin should not be taken with alcohol, the council said. In addition, the labels should tell purchasers that melatonin is intended for intermittent or occasional use only.",
            "Related article\nFeeling older than you are? It could be how you sleep",
            "The council also suggested that melatonin gummies should receive additional warnings, such as a precautionary statement that if not chewed properly, the product could present a potential choking hazard for gummies sold to children under 4 years of age.",
            "The new guidelines also stress the need for manufacturers to adopt child-safety containers for gummies and chewable tablets.",
            "\u201cWhile federal regulations do not require child deterrent closures for melatonin-containing products,\u00a0CRN\u2019s revised guidelines call for industry members to adopt child deterrent packaging for products containing melatonin that are in flavored chewable forms that could be especially attractive to children,\u201d the council said in a statement.",
            "Manufacturers of gummies would have 24 months to implement the changes. However the council \u201curges its members and the broader industry to adopt these guidelines as soon as practicable, with specific implementation timelines provided for each set of guidelines to facilitate a smooth transition.\u201d",

            "According to CHD, the visitor flew from Illinois to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and took a Lyft to the Hyatt Regency Cincinnati around 9 p.m. on Wednesday, April 10.",
            "The visitor also made a stop at Morton's Steakhouse last Wednesday to order takeout.",

            "The CHD said any person who may have been exposed and developed symptoms, including high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a rash beginning three to five days after other symptoms occur, should isolate until testing arrangements can be made.",
            "People are also urged to contact the Cincinnati Health Department at 513-357-7462 for further information.",
            "Health officials also reminded people to check their immunity status, which is reliably conferred by the MMR vaccine, a part of routine childhood immunizations.",
            "The announcement of a positive measles test by a visitor on Monday comes just hours after health officials said no additional cases were reported following a potential measles exposure at Heritage Bank Center last month.",
            "In addition, CHD also reported that COVID-19 infections in the city continue to decrease, and are currently at a low transmission rate.",

            "It\u2019s common knowledge that exercise is good for your mental health and your heart health \u2014 and now a new study suggests that all three are working together.",
            "In addition to the physical benefits of exercise, it\u2019s also associated with a reduction in stress signals in the brain, which leads to a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, according to the study.",
            "Researchers analyzed data of more than 50,000 adults around age 60 from the Mass General Brigham Biobank, according to the study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.",
            "Related article\nWomen might lower their risk for cardiovascular disease by twice the amount as men with exercise",
            "The study looked at a survey that participants were given about their physical activity, imaging of their brains to track activity related to stress, and digital records of cardiovascular events.",
            "\u201cIndividuals who exercise more had a graded reduction in stress related signals in the brain,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Ahmed Tawakol, a cardiologist at Mass General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.",
            "\u201cWe found nice associations that exercise appeared to, in part, reduce heart disease risks by decreasing stress-related signals,\u201d he added.",
            "Everyone should pay attention whenever studies come out that show this kind of improvement resulting from a change in lifestyle, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Freeman was not involved in this study.",
            "\u201cThese are incredibly cost effective, the magnitude of improvements are amazing \u2014 often better than many medications \u2014 and we should be putting these tools in our arsenal for ready use,\u201d he said.",
            "Tawakol and his team also wanted\u00a0to know whether people with more stress-related signals in the brain would get a greater benefit from exercise, he said.",
            "\u201cSurprisingly, we additionally found a greater than twofold increase in benefits of exercise among individuals who are depressed versus individuals who don\u2019t have depression or don\u2019t have a history of depression,\u201d Tawakol said.",
            "The relationship between amount of exercise and decrease in the level of cardiovascular risk also varied depending on whether a person had a history of depression, he added.",
            "For people without any history of depression, the benefit of exercise on cardiovascular disease reduction plateaued after about 300 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. But for people with depression, the benefits continued with more time spent, Tawakol said.",
            "These benefits are in addition to the psychological benefits researchers already know exercise provides, he added.",
            "\u201cWe know depression is an important risk factor for heart disease and it is also one of the most common stress-related conditions,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Karmel Choi, clinical psychologist and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.",
            "\u201cEven though some people may be more susceptible to stress and its health consequences, here we see they may also stand to benefit\u00a0more\u00a0from exercise and its stress-modulating effects. Which is encouraging,\u201d she added in an email.",
            "Exercise reduced stress signals and increased prefrontal cortical signals, Tawakol said.",
            "\u201cBoth are attractive changes in the brain,\u201d he said.",
            "The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain responsible for executive function, which are the cognitive processes that control behavior, Tawakol said.",
            "And stress signals in the brain ar\ufeffe associated with things like inflammation, higher sympathetic nervous system activity, higher blood pressure, and diseases that thicken or harden the arteries, he added.",
            "In part, exercise appeared to reduce heart disease risks by reducing the stress signals, Tawakol said.",
            "These findings are just associations, however. Because the researchers observed participants rather than conducting a randomized trial with a control group, they cannot say for sure that the exercise caused the reductions or what the mechanisms are that underlie it, he said.",
            "You don\u2019t have to be a pro athlete to have a good exercise routine, and it can help to work your way up, Freeman said.",
            "Related article\nAre you making one of these common exercising errors? Experts weigh in",
            "\u201cIt turns out human beings were designed to move and move a lot, and when we do \u2014 particularly when we are outside and amongst trees \u2014 there\u2019s been data to suggest these all have very significant stress-relieving effects.\u201d",
            "Freeman recommends checking with your doctor first and trying to get to 30 minutes a day of breathless physical activity \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter what that activity is.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t enjoy walking or biking or swimming or whatever it is, don\u2019t do it. But figure out a way to get a physical activity in that you truly enjoy,\u201d he said.",
            "Just make sure that it feels difficult for you whatever your fitness level may be, Freeman added. If you can talk in full sentences while exercising, it might be time to make it harder, he said.",
