## 2025-03-29 20:55 UTC - Fixed Image Loading Issues
- Identified the root cause of 404 errors related to blog images

- Fixed by removing the automatic WebP path generation in src/lib/components/ui/Image.svelte
- This resolved the 404 errors for images like whispers-ai-featured.webp
- Updated the work effort documentation with the solution

## 2025-03-29 20:45 UTC - Debugging Svelte Warnings
- Created work effort #18 focused on debugging Svelte warnings
- Taking a structured approach to address issues one at a time
- Focus areas include unused CSS selectors, accessibility warnings, and unused exports
