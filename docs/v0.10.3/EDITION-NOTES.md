# Surviving the Singularity v0.10.3

September 28, 2026. Eight additional graphics and a focused publication polish pass on v0.10.2. The reading PDF remains 408 pages. All 35 sections, existing prose, 102 previous image references and 24 precedents are preserved. The canonical manuscript now contains 110 image references, including 62 registered figures.

Open the [reading PDF](../../book-build/Surviving-the-Singularity-v0.10.3.pdf), [EPUB](../../book-build/Surviving-the-Singularity-v0.10.3.epub), or [grayscale print interior](../../book-build/Surviving-the-Singularity-v0.10.3-print-interior.pdf). The [delivery manifest](deliverables.json) records six outputs and their checksums.

## New artwork

Four original narrative illustrations use warm ink contours and restrained washes: the Bear Flag toast, Elijah at his window at dawn, Marta passing the beans, and Rosa speaking at the county hearing. Their captions identify them as fictional scenes. They were generated with built-in image_gen from the manuscript, without external image references. [Prompts and generation paths](narrative-art/generation.json), [asset records](narrative-art/integration.json), and [visual review](narrative-art/review.json) accompany the edition. The final PNGs are in `static/book-images/v103-narrative-*.png`.

Four native SVG graphics explain the three reading routes, continuing service costs, an offline retrieval check and the first-year practice plan. Each has a screen and light print variant. Labels measure at least 9.58 pt at the book's 4.56-inch image width. The [editable generator](figures_practical.py), [integration records](practical-art/integration.json) and [geometry checks](practical-art/checks.json) include four deliberately failing controls. No new numerical dataset or factual claim was introduced.

## Page polish

- Chapter 19 now opens into its narrative. Moving the ladder beside its explanation removes the blank and title-only pages.
- The greenhouse explanation stays together before its component map.
- Appendix D opens with its usable precedent ledger before the timeline.
- Unnumbered headings no longer repeat the same words as both label and title.
- Credits put general provenance before individual entries and end without an isolated short leaf.

The [layout review](LAYOUT-REVIEW.md) records before/after evidence. Existing prose and image/caption blocks were moved intact. The [source check](source-checks.json) verifies their remaining exact block order, all earlier artwork bytes, 36 prior source hashes and six previous deliveries. Its five negative controls detect missing prose, a removed image, an altered old caption, unexpected prose and a changed baseline. [Stable ID review](INDEX-REVIEW.md): all 2,285 existing IDs matched by content, with zero positional guesses; 16 new blocks bring the total to 2,301.

## Verification and deliveries

PDF proof checks all 2,607 source text blocks and all 62 registered figures, with no missing text, figure-layout errors, overflow, missing assets or broken internal links. The color interior has 407 pages; the reading PDF adds the cover, and the print interior adds an empty final verso. [Final visual review](pdf-proof/FINAL-PDF-REVIEW.md) covers every new illustration in color and grayscale, the moved figures, chapter transitions and the ending. [Resource checks](../publication/PDF-RESOURCE-CHECKS.md) cover embedded fonts, geometry, navigation, grayscale and page-by-page text preservation, with deliberate failure controls.

The [EPUB review](EPUB-REVIEW.md) verifies 35 sections, 2,656 source blocks and all 110 image placements. All 62 registered figures pass packaged-resource browser checks at 390 and 768 pixels; all eight additions were visually inspected at both sizes. The [web reader review](READER-REVIEW.md) checks 62 figures at mobile and desktop widths, all eight additions in both readers, and retained scene stills and text details. No application source change was needed.

The [production instructions](../../publication/README.md) cover rebuilds and the editable publication package. This pass expands art and improves layout; it does not repeat the full v0.10.2 factual reread. Physical printing and dedicated e-reader pagination remain untested. Existing cover and quotation decisions remain in the publication audits. The public-download version remains 0.7.5. No commit or deployment was made.
