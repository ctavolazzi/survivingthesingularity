# DARPA Seeks Plans for 'Large Bio-Mechanical Space Structures'

In a move that sounds straight out of science fiction, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has issued a request for information on developing massive "bio-mechanical space structures." The agency, known for funding cutting-edge and sometimes seemingly impossible technological concepts, is exploring the feasibility of creating enormous space structures that integrate biological components.

## Biological Growth in the Vacuum of Space

According to DARPA's request, they're investigating the potential for "large, self-assembled, mechanically stable biological growths in space" that could exceed 1,600 feet in length. These structures would "disrupt the current state-of-the-art and position biology as a complementary component of the in-space assembly infrastructure."

The concept leverages biological systems' inherent advantages: rapid growth with minimal human intervention and the ability to self-assemble. This approach could revolutionize how we build large structures in space by significantly reducing the costs and logistical challenges of launching building materials from Earth.

## Potential Applications

DARPA envisions several potential applications for these bio-mechanical space structures:

- Tethers for a space elevator
- Grid-nets for orbital debris remediation
- Kilometer-scale interferometers for radio science
- Self-assembled wings for commercial space stations to host additional payloads
- On-demand production of patch materials to repair micrometeorite damage

## The Biological "Tent Cover"

To help visualize the concept, DARPA used the analogy of a tent. The traditional structural materials (like metal components) would serve as the "tent poles," while biological growth mechanisms would form the "cover" of the tent. This approach could allow for much larger and more complex structures than conventional assembly methods alone.

The biological components would essentially fill in the gaps between essential electronic or structural elements, creating a cohesive and functional whole.

## An Ambitious Leap Forward

This initiative represents a significant leap beyond current Earth-based bioengineering efforts, such as using mycelium as building material. While we've explored using biological materials in construction on Earth, applying these principles in the vacuum and radiation of space presents entirely new challenges.

DARPA acknowledges the ambitious nature of this concept and plans to hold a "sponsored workshop" in April to discuss relevant future research directions. This gathering will likely bring together experts in synthetic biology, materials science, aerospace engineering, and other relevant fields.

## Funding Uncertainties

The timing of this initiative comes as Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is examining Department of Defense spending, potentially leading to budget cuts and layoffs. How this might impact DARPA's more speculative research efforts remains to be seen.

## The Future of Space Construction

If successful, this bio-mechanical approach could transform how we build in space. Rather than launching prefabricated components or relying on robotic assembly, we might someday "grow" our space stations, solar arrays, and other infrastructure in orbit.

This approach aligns with broader efforts to utilize in-situ resources and minimize the materials that need to be launched from Earth, which remains one of the most significant cost factors in space development.

The concept of biological space structures may seem far-fetched today, but it's worth remembering that many technologies we now take for granted—including the internet and GPS—began as DARPA projects that seemed equally speculative at the time.

As we continue to expand our presence in space, innovative approaches like bio-mechanical structures may prove essential for creating the large-scale infrastructure needed for a sustainable human presence beyond Earth.
