## FarmBot Yield Analysis

FarmBot has conducted an in-depth analysis of its food production capacity, addressing common questions about yield and the size of FarmBot needed to meet various food production goals.

### Crop Selection and Data

- The analysis included 33 common crops compatible with FarmBot technology.
- Excluded were tall crops (e.g., corn, sunflowers), fruit trees, berry bushes (except strawberries), and grain crops.
- Data collected for each crop: average yield per harvest (kg/mÂ²/harvest), average days till harvest (days/harvest), and caloric density (calories/kg).

### Key Findings

1. **Calorie Production:**
   - Using an average of all 33 crops: 9.74 calories/mÂ²/day
   - Using an average of the top 10 performing crops: 18.21 calories/mÂ²/day

2. **FarmBot Size for Calorie Needs:**
   - For a 2,000 calorie diet: 110-205 mÂ² (using best 10 crops vs. all crops average)
   - For a 2,500 calorie diet: 137-257 mÂ²
   - For a family of 4-5 (10,000 calories): 549-1,027 mÂ²

3. **Cups of Vegetables vs. Calories:**
   - FarmBot is more efficient at producing the recommended daily cups of vegetables rather than total caloric needs.
   - Average production: 0.42 cups/mÂ²/day
   - Top 10 crops average: 1.00 cups/mÂ²/day

4. **FarmBot Models and Vegetable Production:**
   - FarmBot Express (3.6 mÂ²): 1.5-3.6 cups/day
   - FarmBot Genesis (4.5 mÂ²): 1.9-4.5 cups/day
   - FarmBot Express XL (14.4 mÂ²): 6.0-14.4 cups/day
   - FarmBot Genesis XL (18 mÂ²): 7.6-18.0 cups/day
   - FarmBot Express MAX (43.2 mÂ²): 18.0-43.2 cups/day
   - FarmBot Genesis MAX (54 mÂ²): 22.8-54.0 cups/day

### Practical Implications

1. **Daily Vegetable Needs:** Both FarmBot Express and FarmBot Genesis can produce enough vegetables for one person's daily needs (recommended 3 cups/day).

2. **Family Production:** XL models can produce enough vegetables for a family of 4-5 people daily, while MAX models can produce significantly more.

3. **Calorie Production:** While FarmBot is not designed to meet all caloric needs, it can significantly contribute to a household's vegetable intake.

4. **Yield Optimization:** Users can increase yield by:
   - Selecting high-performing crops or varieties
   - Placing vining and indeterminate crops near bed edges and training them outwards, potentially doubling or tripling the utilized area

5. **Supplementary Food Source:** FarmBot is best viewed as a highly efficient system for producing fresh vegetables, complementing rather than replacing other food sources.

## Conclusion

This yield analysis demonstrates that FarmBot is a viable solution for producing a household's daily vegetable needs, particularly when focusing on high-yielding crops. While it may not meet all caloric requirements, FarmBot offers an efficient and automated way to grow fresh, homegrown vegetables. The system's flexibility allows users to optimize their crop selection and growing strategies to maximize yield based on their specific needs and preferences.

- Total estimated emissions: ~95.4 kg CO2
- Main contributors:
  - Aluminum: 78.3 kg CO2
  - Stainless Steel: 8.6 kg CO2
  - Plastic: 7.1 kg CO2

Note: The actual emissions may be closer to 150 kg CO2 when considering the manufacturing processes beyond raw materials.

### Emissions from FarmBot Operation

Based on estimated power consumption of various components:

- Total annual electricity usage: 104.9 kWh
- Estimated annual CO2 emissions: 58.09 kg CO2
- Daily CO2 emissions: 0.159 kg CO2

Key assumptions:
- US average CO2 emissions per kWh: 0.554 kg CO2/kWh
- Varied duty cycles for different components (e.g., 100% for computer, 5% for motors)

### Comparison with Store-Bought Vegetables

1. FarmBot-grown vegetables:
   - Carbon intensity: 2.05 g CO2/calorie

2. Average US store-bought vegetables:
   - Carbon intensity: 2.8 g CO2/calorie

Key finding: FarmBot-grown vegetables emit 25-30% less CO2 than store-bought vegetables.

### Additional Environmental Benefits
