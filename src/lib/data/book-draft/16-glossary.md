# Glossary

## A

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

**Algorithm**: A set of rules or instructions given to an AI, neural network, or other machine to help it learn on its own.

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: A hypothetical type of AI that would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence to solve any problem, much like a human.

**Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**: AI that specializes in one area or task. Also known as Narrow AI or Weak AI.

**Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**: A form of AI that surpasses human intelligence and ability in virtually all domains.

## B

**Big Data**: Extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations.

**Blockchain**: A decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers.

## C

**ChatGPT**: An AI language model developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text based on the input it receives.

**Computer Vision**: A field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.

## D

**Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers.

**Data Mining**: The process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.

## E

**Expert System**: An AI system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.

## F

**Facial Recognition**: A technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or video frame.

## G

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: A type of large language model using deep learning to produce human-like text.

## M

**Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken or written.

**Neural Network**: A series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.

## R

**Robotics**: The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.

## S

**Singularity**: A hypothetical future point in time when artificial intelligence becomes so advanced that it triggers runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization.

**Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset.

## T

**Turing Test**: A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.

## U

**Unsupervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset and left to find patterns on its own.

## V

**Virtual Reality (VR)**: A simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world.
