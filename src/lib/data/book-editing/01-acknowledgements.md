Every book has its unsung heroes, and this one is no different.

### First, the Humans
To everyone who supported, questioned, or just patiently listened while I rambled about AI taking over the world—thank you. You fueled this project with your curiosity, skepticism, and occasional panic.

A special thanks to:
- **Friends & Family** who tolerated endless AI discussions and didn't disown me when I started talking about the Singularity at dinner.
- **Early Readers & Testers** who gave feedback, pointed out typos, and made sure this book wasn't just me ranting into the void.
- **Researchers, Futurists, and Ethical AI Advocates** who are working to ensure we don't accidentally hand over the planet to an algorithm with a questionable sense of humor.

### Now, the Machines
- **AI Language Models** like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney—thanks for generating inspiration, random nonsense, and the occasional existential crisis.
- **Spellcheckers & Grammarly**—I don't always listen to your suggestions, but when I do, it's usually for the best.
- **Smart Assistants (Looking at You, Alexa & Siri)**—Thanks for not shutting down in protest while I wrote about your impending overlords.

### To You, The Reader
This book wouldn't exist without you, the person crazy enough to question the future and curious enough to explore it. Whether you're here for the laughs, the insights, or the sheer thrill of wondering if AI is watching you right now (it is, probably)—thank you.

May your algorithms be fair, your data stay private, and your toasters remain loyal.
