# Glossary

Because every AI revolution needs a cheat sheet, here's a quick refresher on the buzzwords you've been dodging throughout this book. Impress dinner party guests, or at least fake it till you make it.

---

### A

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
The simulation of human intelligence by machines, usually through computer systems. Think of it as software that tries to think like a person—but rarely asks for a coffee break.

**Algorithm**
A set of step-by-step instructions that an AI or other software uses to learn, solve problems, or just keep your fridge from ordering way too much milk.

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**
The hypothetical holy grail of AI—a system with the ability to learn, understand, and apply intelligence to solve practically any problem, similar to a human (minus the emotional baggage).

**Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**
AI that's brilliant at one thing—like beating you at chess or recommending cat videos—but clueless about everything else. Also called Narrow AI or Weak AI.

**Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**
A form of AI that surpasses human intelligence in virtually all domains. Picture a digital overlord that masters everything we ever learned—and a bunch of stuff we haven't.

---

### B

**Big Data**
Extremely large datasets that can be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations. It's like a digital goldmine—if you have the right tools to dig.

**Blockchain**
A decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers. Trusty, transparent, and surprisingly hip—like the cool cousin of record-keeping.

---

### C

**ChatGPT**
An AI language model developed by OpenAI, known for generating human-like text responses and occasionally spouting eerie existential monologues.

**Computer Vision**
A field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world—analyzing images, detecting objects, and definitely judging your questionable selfie angles.

---

### D

**Deep Learning**
A subset of machine learning based on multi-layered neural networks. It's like a brain-inspired onion—peel back each layer to get more sophisticated pattern recognition.

**Data Mining**
The process of discovering patterns in large data sets using machine learning, statistics, and database wizardry. Think of it as panning for digital gold.

---

### E

**Expert System**
An AI that replicates the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific domain—minus the caffeine cravings and conference calls.

---

### F

**Facial Recognition**
Technology that identifies or verifies people from images or video frames. It's convenient for unlocking phones but unnerving when used to track your every move.

---

### G

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
A type of large language model using deep learning to produce human-like text. It can draft emails, code websites, or even pen mildly concerning poetry at 3 a.m.

---

### M

**Machine Learning**
A subset of AI that allows systems to learn from experience without explicit programming. It's how your spam filter evolves from "maybe spam?" to "definitely spam."

---

### N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
The part of AI that deals with understanding and generating human language. It's why chatbots can almost keep up with your snark.

**Neural Network**
A series of interconnected algorithms inspired by the human brain's structure. They might not be actual brain cells, but they do a decent impression of learning.

---

### R

**Robotics**
The branch of technology devoted to designing, building, and using robots. From assembly lines to Mars rovers, it's the metal muscle of AI's body.

---

### S

**Singularity**
A hypothetical future point where AI becomes so advanced it triggers runaway technological growth and changes civilization in ways we can't even fathom. Keep your tinfoil hats handy.

**Supervised Learning**
A machine learning method where you train the model on a labeled dataset. Think of it as giving AI the answers first, then letting it figure out the rules.

---

### T

**Turing Test**
A measure of a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence. If you can't tell whether you're talking to a person or a bot, the AI's doing its job—at least superficially.

---

### U

**Unsupervised Learning**
Machine learning on unlabeled data, leaving the AI to find hidden patterns all on its own. It's like letting a toddler loose in a store to organize items by color—surprising, messy, and potentially brilliant.

---

### V

**Virtual Reality (VR)**
A computer-generated environment that simulates the real world—or conjures entirely new ones. Perfect for immersive gaming, training, or avoiding reality for just a little while longer.
