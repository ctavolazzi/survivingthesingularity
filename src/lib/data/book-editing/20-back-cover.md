Welcome to the Future. Hope You Brought Snacks.

Real AI isn't coming—it's here. And whether it's optimizing your investments, recommending your next binge-watch, or quietly replacing your coworkers, it's changing everything. Surviving the Singularity is your no-nonsense, darkly funny guide to navigating this brave (and occasionally terrifying) new world, where the robots don't just take orders—they make them.

Inside, you'll learn:
- How AI is reshuffling the economy—goodbye cubicles, hello automation for everything.
- Why your next doctor will probably be an algorithm (one that's a lot better at diagnosis).
- Whether your dating apps are setting you up with a human… or a chatbot.
- How to adapt to a world where artificial intelligence isn't just a tool, but a force reshaping everything we know.

Packed with real-world insights, expert analysis, and enough gallows humor to make a doomsday prepper chuckle, Surviving the Singularity is essential reading for anyone who wants to stay human in the age of the machines.

The Singularity is near. Are you ready?
