# Chapter 2: Show Me the Money (While It Still Exists)

Alright, future-dwellers, now that we've established that yes, this whole AI thing is indeed a big freaking deal, let's talk about what's really keeping you up at night: your wallet.

I get it. You're thinking, "Sure, AI is cool and all, but will I still be able to afford my daily latte it's the only thing I look forward to in this cold world?" Well, get ready to rule your caffeine addiction because we're about to take a wild ride through the future of money, jobs, and why your great-grandkids might look at your paycheck the same way you look at stone tablets.

## The Great Job Shuffle (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bot)

Picture this: It's a crisp Monday morning in 2023, and John Miller is pulling into the parking lot of Midwest Manufacturing, the same way he has for the past 20 years. But today, something's different. There's a sleek, unfamiliar truck parked in the loading bay, emblazoned with the logo "AI-utomation Solutions." John's stomach churns. He's heard rumors, but surely it can't be happening here, not yet...

First things first: Yes, AI is coming for jobs. Lots of them. But before you start panic-learning how to weave baskets underwater, let's take a deep breath and look at the bigger picture.

Remember how the industrial revolution put a bunch of horse-drawn carriage drivers out of business? And then how computers made typewriter repairmen obsolete? Well, AI is like that, but on steroids, wearing a jetpack, and it's getting closer faster and faster every day.

Here's the deal: AI is going to make a lot of current jobs obsolete. Possibly all of them. We're talking everything from truck drivers to stock traders, from radiologists to, well, maybe even some writers (gulp). But here's the kicker: it's also going to create a whole bunch of new jobs we can't even imagine yet.

## The Numbers Game

Let's throw some numbers at this situation:

- A 2020 World Economic Forum report predicted that by 2025, 85 million jobs may be displaced by AI, but 97 million new roles may emerge.
- McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2030, 375 million workers (about 14% of the global workforce) may need to switch occupational categories due to AI and automation.

These aren't just abstract figures. They represent real people, real careers, real lives. But they also represent opportunity.

Think about it: a century ago, could anyone have predicted "social media manager" or "app developer" would be career options? Of course not. They were too busy churning butter or whatever.

So while AI might be eyeing your job like a robot Terminator, it's also opening up new frontiers of work. We might soon see:

- AI Ethicists
- Robot-Human Interaction Specialists
- Personal AI Trainers
- Virtual Reality Architects
- Drone Traffic Controllers
- And probably a whole bunch of jobs we can't even conceive of yet.

(Time travelers from 2050, feel free to leave a comment below with the weirdest job titles you've got. We could use a laugh.)

## The Gig Economy on Steroids (or How to Juggle 17 Jobs at Once)

Now, let's talk about the gig economy. You know, that thing where instead of having one steady job, you piece together a living from various gigs, like an economic jigsaw puzzle.

Well, AI is about to pour rocket fuel on that particular fire. With AI handling more and more routine tasks, we're likely to see a rise in project-based work. You might find yourself jumping from gig to gig, leveraging your uniquely human skills in creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving.

Imagine a typical work week in 2030:

- Monday morning: Collaborate with an AI to design a new product
- Tuesday afternoon: Teach empathy skills to customer service robots
- Wednesday morning: Work as a professional cuddler for humans who are touch-starved in our increasingly digital world (That's already a thing, by the way. Look it up.)
- Thursday: Moonlight as a virtual reality architect for AI-generated dream sequences
- Friday: Spend the day as an AI-human translator, helping companies understand the nuances of their AI's outputs

The upside? More flexibility, diverse experiences, and the chance to wear seventeen different hats (metaphorically, unless you're into that sort of thing). The downside? You might need to explain to your grandma that no, you don't have "a job," you have seven of them, and one of them involves being a digital forest ranger in the metaverse. Good luck with that conversation.

**Pause and Reflect:** How would you feel about having multiple gigs instead of a traditional job? What skills do you have that could be adapted to this new work paradigm?

## The Universal Basic Income Plot Twist

Now, here's where things get really interesting. As AI and robotics advance, they're likely to create something economists have been dreaming about (or having nightmares about, depending on who you ask) for centuries: abundance.

Imagine a world where robots and AI can produce most of the goods and services we need. Food, energy, manufacturing â€“ all handled by tireless machines that don't need sleep, vacations, or motivational posters with cats hanging from tree branches.

In this world of abundance, the idea of "earning a living" starts to sound as quaint as churning your own butter or hunting your own mammoths. Enter the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI).

### UBI: Not Just Monopoly Money

The idea is simple: everyone gets a basic income, regardless of whether they work or not. It's like an allowance, but instead of coming from your parents, it comes from the society-wide surplus generated by our new robot overlords.

"But wait," I hear you cry, "won't people just become lazy good-for-nothings if they don't have to work?" Well, maybe. But consider this:

- Maslow's hierarchy of needs suggests that once basic survival is taken care of, people tend to seek self-actualization and creative expression.
- Several UBI experiments have shown that people generally don't stop working. They often pursue education, start businesses, or engage in community service.
- A 2016-2017 UBI experiment in Finland found that recipients had better mental well-being, slightly better employment outcomes, and more trust in social institutions.

Plus, let's be real: even with UBI, humans will still find ways to compete and achieve. We're a species that invented competitive hot dog eating, for crying out loud. We'll find ways to stay busy.

## The Great Wealth Redistribution (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Sharing)

Now, I know what you're thinking. "This all sounds great, but who's going to pay for it? And what about the billionaires? Won't somebody please think of the billionaires?"

Here's the thing: in a world of AI-driven abundance, our current concepts of wealth and ownership are going to need a serious overhaul. When an AI can design and a robot can build pretty much anything, what does it mean to "own" something?

We might be heading towards a world where access trumps ownership. Think less "I own this car" and more "I have access to transportation whenever I need it." It's like Netflix, but for... well, everything.

### The Ownership Paradox

Consider this:

- The world's five richest people have a combined wealth of over $500 billion.
- Meanwhile, according to the World Bank, about 700 million people live in extreme poverty.

In a post-scarcity economy, these kinds of wealth disparities might become not just morally questionable, but logically absurd. After all, what's the point of hoarding wealth when abundance is the norm?

As for the billionaires, well, let's just say that hoarding wealth in a post-scarcity economy might become as socially acceptable as hoarding toilet paper during a pandemic. Not cool, Jeff. Not cool.

**What Would You Do?** You're the CEO of a mid-sized company. AI could increase your productivity by 30% but would displace 20% of your workforce. What's your move?

## Survival Strategies (or How to Thrive When the Robots Take Over)

So, how do you navigate this brave new world of AI-driven economics? Here are a few tips:

1. Embrace lifelong learning: The only constant in the future job market will be change. Get comfortable with constantly learning new skills. Think less "career ladder" and more "career jungle gym."

2. Cultivate your humanity: Focus on developing skills that are (currently) uniquely human: creativity, emotional intelligence, complex problem-solving, and adaptability. Robots might be able to crunch numbers faster than you, but can they write a sonnet that makes people cry? (Don't answer that, I don't want to know.)

3. Diversify your skill set: Don't put all your eggs in one career basket. The more diverse your skills, the more adaptable you'll be to whatever the future throws at you.

4. Get comfortable with uncertainty: The future is going to be weird, wild, and wonderfully unpredictable. Embrace it.

5. Start thinking about your post-scarcity passion: When you don't have to work to survive, what will you do with your time? Start exploring now. Maybe underwater basket weaving isn't such a bad idea after all.

6. Develop your personal brand: In a gig economy on steroids, your personal brand will be your career lifeline. Start building it now.

7. Learn to work with AI: AI won't replace all human workers, but humans who know how to work with AI will replace those who don't.

Remember, the goal isn't just to survive the coming economic upheaval, but to thrive in it. Yes, things are going to change dramatically. But humans are adaptable. We survived ice ages, plagues, and the invention of the selfie stick. We'll survive this too.

## Food for Thought

As we wrap up this whirlwind tour of our potential economic future, here are a few questions to ponder:

1. In a world where most traditional jobs are automated, how would you find purpose and meaning?

2. If you had a guaranteed basic income, what would you do with your time?

3. How might concepts like "wealth" and "success" change in a post-scarcity world?

4. What potential downsides or challenges do you see in a UBI system?

5. How might education systems need to change to prepare people for this new economic reality?

So buckle up, future-dwellers. The economy of the future is going to be a wild ride. But hey, at least we won't have to worry about retirement savings when we have robot butlers and unlimited resources, right?

...Right?
