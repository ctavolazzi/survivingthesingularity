          "question": "What is embodied AI?",
          "answer": "Embodied AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through a body or physical form, allowing them to learn and operate in real-world environments. Recent examples include Figure's Helix VLA model for humanoid control, Unitree's G1 robot, and Cortical Labs' CL1 biological intelligence system."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does natural language control work in embodied AI?",
          "answer": "Advanced systems like Figure's Helix use Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that translate natural language commands directly into physical actions. This allows robots to understand and execute complex tasks like picking up novel objects or collaborating with other robots, without requiring specific programming for each task."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the key components of modern humanoid robots?",
          "answer": "Modern humanoid robots like the Unitree G1 feature multiple degrees of freedom (23-43 joints), force-controlled dexterous hands, advanced sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras), and sophisticated AI control systems. They typically include high-performance computing units, battery systems for autonomous operation, and continuous OTA update capabilities."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do biological and artificial components work together?",
          "answer": "Systems like the CL1 combine biological neural networks with artificial components to create hybrid intelligence. This approach leverages the adaptability and learning capabilities of biological systems while maintaining the precision and reliability of artificial components."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the main challenges in embodied AI?",
          "answer": "Key challenges include achieving natural object manipulation, maintaining stable bipedal movement, managing power consumption, and developing general-purpose intelligence that can adapt to new situations. Recent breakthroughs like Helix's VLA model are addressing these by enabling zero-shot learning and natural language control."
