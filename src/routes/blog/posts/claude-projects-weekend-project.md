# Unleash Your Productivity with Claude Projects: A Weekend Challenge

Are you ready to supercharge your AI workflow? Get excited, because we're about to dive into Claude Projects - an innovative feature that's transforming how we interact with AI. As a teacher who's gathered insights from over 600 educators worldwide, I can tell you that Claude Projects is causing a stir in the education community and beyond. The best part? It's available to all Claude Pro and Team users!

## What are Claude Projects?

Claude Projects allow you to organize your work with Claude, enhance its knowledge, and significantly boost your productivity. By leveraging the expanded 200K token context window (that's about 500 pages of text!), you can tackle complex tasks, customize Claude for specific roles, and create valuable outputs with AI assistance.
