# Work Effort: Micro-animations Addition

## Objective
Add subtle but impactful micro-animations to the page to create immediate visual interest, draw attention to key elements, and signal a premium, thoughtfully designed experience.

## Current State
The page has some animations, but they're subtle and mostly on scroll or hover. The initial page load lacks dynamic elements that could create an immediate "wow" factor.

## Implemented Changes
1. Added staggered entrance animations to the hero section:
   - Fly-in animation for the hero badge (from top)
   - Fly-in animation for the hero title (from bottom)
   - Fade-in animation for the description
   - Delayed fade-in for the scroll button

2. Added entrance animation to the social proof banner:
   - Subtle fly-in animation that follows the hero elements

3. Added pulsing/glowing effects to CTAs:
   - Implemented a pulsing glow effect for primary buttons
   - Added a subtle ripple animation to the scroll button

4. Implemented accessibility considerations:
   - Added prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion

## Rationale
Motion draws the eye immediately and signals that this is a premium, thoughtfully designed experience. These brief "wow" moments set the tone for perceived quality throughout the user journey. The staggered reveal creates a sense of intentional storytelling as elements appear in a logical sequence.

## Implementation Details
1. Used Svelte's built-in transition system (fly, fade) for entrance animations
2. Created custom CSS animations for the pulsing and ripple effects
3. Used z-index and positioning to ensure animations don't interfere with content
4. Implemented appropriate timing and delays to create a pleasing sequence
5. Added accessibility features for users who prefer reduced motion

## Success Metrics
- Increased time spent on the landing page
- Reduced bounce rate
- Higher interaction with animated elements
- Improved conversion rates on CTAs with micro-animations
- Positive feedback on page design and user experience
