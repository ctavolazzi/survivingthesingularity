# Work Effort: Accuracy Verification

## Objective
Ensure all content on the page makes accurate claims and avoids presenting unverified information as fact.

## Current State
The page currently contains:
1. Social proof banner with specific numerical claims ("10,000+ forward-thinkers")
2. Claims about notable affiliations ("Engineers from Google, Microsoft, and Tesla")
3. Hero description claiming "Our proven resources have helped thousands prepare"

These are specific factual claims that should not be made without verification.

## Implemented Changes
1. Replaced specific numerical claims with general language about "growing community"
2. Removed references to specific companies in favor of "various tech industries and backgrounds"
3. Rewrote the hero description to simply state "Our resources help you prepare" without claiming proven impact or scale
4. Updated all documentation to reflect accurate descriptions without unverified claims

## Rationale
Making specific factual claims without verification can damage credibility and trust. Using more general language maintains the psychological impact of social proof without risking misinformation.

## Implementation Details
1. Updated the social proof banner text to use general language about community
2. Removed company badge styling since specific companies are no longer mentioned
3. Modified the hero description to remove claims about thousands of users
4. Updated all documentation to ensure consistency with the implementation
5. Preserved the visual design elements while removing unverified claims

## Success Metrics
- All content on the page avoids unverified factual claims
- Social proof elements maintain their impact while using verified or general language
- Documentation accurately reflects the implemented changes
