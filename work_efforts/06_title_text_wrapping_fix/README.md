# Title Text Breaking Fix

## 🚩 Objectives
- Fix the page titles so they maintain their large size and impact while ensuring proper text wrapping behavior
- Ensure words in headings don't get cut off or wrap inappropriately
- Allow headings to flow naturally onto multiple lines when needed

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Modify heading styles to ensure proper text wrapping while preventing word breaks
- [x] Maintain large font sizes across all screen sizes
- [x] Restore full descriptive heading text
- [x] Update responsive styling for different breakpoints
- [x] Test across various screen widths

## 📝 Notes
The previous implementation was using `white-space: nowrap` which forced all titles onto a single line. This approach was problematic because:
1. It required shortening headings to fit
2. It could cause horizontal overflow on small screens
3. It made the text difficult to read on mobile

The new approach allows titles to flow naturally onto multiple lines while maintaining their visual impact.

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Finding the right balance between font size and readability on small screens
- Ensuring proper line height for multiline headings

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- Headings now maintain their large size while wrapping appropriately at word boundaries
- Words are never cut off or inappropriately broken
- The original, more descriptive title text has been restored
- Text remains fully readable across all device sizes
- Visual impact is maintained through proper font sizing
