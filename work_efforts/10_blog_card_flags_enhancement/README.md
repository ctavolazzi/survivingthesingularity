# Blog Card Flags Enhancement

## 🚩 Objectives
- Fix the illegible blog card flags/tags (particularly "AI Insights")
- Add more variety to the flags based on blog post content
- Improve overall readability and visual appeal of the flags

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Increase font size of the flags to improve readability
- [x] Enhance contrast between flag text and background
- [x] Implement dynamic flags based on blog post content instead of hardcoded "AI Insights"
- [x] Add visual enhancements to make flags more prominent and attractive
- [x] Test across various screen sizes and environments

## 📝 Notes
The previous implementation had several issues:
1. All blog cards displayed the same "AI Insights" flag regardless of content
2. The flags were difficult to read due to small font size (0.8rem)
3. Contrast and visibility needed improvement

We implemented a solution that:
1. Uses a variety of category flags (Opinion, Tech, News, Science, etc.) based on post content
2. Applies different colors to each category for better visual distinction
3. Increases font size from 0.8rem to 0.9rem with improved contrast
4. Adds text transform, letter spacing, and text shadow for better readability
5. Enhances visual appeal with slightly larger padding, better drop shadows, and subtle animation effects

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Initial flags were illegible due to small font size (0.8rem)
- Lack of variety made all blog posts look the same
- Flags needed better visual treatment to stand out against blog image backgrounds

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- Blog card flags are now much more legible with larger text and improved styling
- Each post now has a relevant category flag instead of generic "AI Insights"
- Color coding adds visual interest and helps users quickly identify content types
- Hover effects add subtle animation for a more interactive experience
- Improved consistency with the news ticker component which already used varied tags
