# Work Effort: Superfluous Routes Removal

## Status: Completed ✅
**Started:** 2025-01-27
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27
**Completed:** 2025-01-27

## Objective
Remove the download route and any other superfluous routes that are not accessible through the main navigation to clean up the codebase and eliminate unnecessary functionality.

## Background
After reviewing the navbar, only a few routes are actually linked: `/`, `/about`, `/blog`, and `/sample` (mobile only). Many other routes exist but are not accessible through navigation and serve no purpose.

## Current Routes Analysis

### Routes in Navbar ✅ (Keep)
- `/` - Home page
- `/about` - About page
- `/blog` - Blog page
- `/sample` - Sample page (mobile nav only)

### Routes NOT in Navbar ❌ (Remove)
- `/download` - Download page (not linked anywhere)
- `/discord` - Discord page (not linked, Discord functionality removed)
- `/code-conductor` - Code conductor page (not linked)
- `/tactics` - Tactics page (not linked)
- `/resources` - Resources page (not linked)
- `/profile` - Profile page (not linked)
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard page (not linked)

### Routes in Footer ✅ (Keep)
- `/policies` - Policies page (linked in footer with Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Usage Guidelines, and Disclaimers)

### Routes to Keep (Special Purpose)
- `/book` - Book reading functionality
- `/api` - API endpoints (needed for functionality)
