# Work Effort: Build Pipeline Verification

## Status: Not Started
**Started:** 2025-01-27 21:00
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27 21:00

## Objective
Verify and optimize the complete build pipeline to ensure reliable production deployments and optimal performance.

## Tasks
1. [ ] Test full production build: `npm run build`
2. [ ] Verify image optimization pipeline works end-to-end
3. [ ] Check all static assets are properly processed
4. [ ] Test deployment adapter compatibility
5. [ ] Validate prebuild hooks function correctly
6. [ ] Test build reproducibility across environments
7. [ ] Optimize build performance if needed

## Progress
- ‚è≥ Not yet started

## Dependencies
- [[40.01_image_optimization_migration]] - Understanding current image pipeline
- [[../50_maintenance/50.01_svelte_warnings_cleanup_migration]] - Clean codebase

## Success Criteria
- Production build completes without errors
- All images properly optimized and served
- Static assets generate correctly
- Build process is documented and repeatable
- Build time is optimized (target: <2 minutes)
- No broken asset references in production

## Build Components to Verify
- **SvelteKit build process**
- **Image optimization hooks** (`image_build_hook.js`)
- **Static asset processing**
- **Markdown compilation**
- **CSS/Tailwind compilation**
- **Adapter configuration**

## Test Cases
```
1. Clean build from scratch
2. Incremental build after changes
3. Build with different NODE_ENV settings
4. Build verification on different platforms
5. Asset integrity verification
```

## Next Steps
1. Wait for [[../50_maintenance/50.01_svelte_warnings_cleanup_migration]] completion
2. Run initial build test
3. Document any issues discovered

## Notes
- Critical for launch readiness
- Current build includes custom prebuild script for blog posts
- Image optimization is a key performance factor
