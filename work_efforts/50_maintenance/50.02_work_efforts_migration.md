## Success Criteria

- Navigation between work efforts functions via Obsidian links
- No broken internal references

## Migration Map
```
Legacy â†’ New Location
â”œâ”€â”€ 12_image_optimization_enhancements â†’ 40.01
â”œâ”€â”€ 16_neuralink_image_update â†’ 20.04
â”œâ”€â”€ 17_blog_post_whispers_of_future â†’ 20.03
â”œâ”€â”€ 18_debug_svelte_warnings â†’ 50.01
â””â”€â”€ agi_roadmap â†’ 10.01
```

## Next Steps
1. Begin with [[../40_infrastructure/40.01_image_optimization_migration]]
2. Update [[../40_infrastructure/40.00_index]] with new link
3. Continue systematically through all legacy folders

## Notes
- Preserve all content and context from original work efforts
