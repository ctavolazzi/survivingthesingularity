*Created: 2024-03-19 15:45 UTC*

## Overview
Create a new component for the home page that displays the remaining technological announcements needed to achieve AGI, effectively answering the "what's next?" question for visitors.

## Goals
- Create a visually appealing component showing the path to AGI
- List and categorize remaining technological breakthroughs needed
- Show how these technologies would link together to form AGI
- Provide context for each required technology
- Make the information easily digestible for visitors

## Component Details
### Name
`AGIRoadmap.svelte`

### Location
`src/lib/components/AGIRoadmap.svelte`

### Features
- Interactive timeline of required technologies
- Visual indicators for progress/completion status
- Links between related technologies
- Brief descriptions of each technology's role in AGI
- Estimated announcement dates (if available)
- Visual categorization of different technology types

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Technology {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: 'hardware' | 'software' | 'neuroscience' | 'robotics' | 'other';
  status: 'pending' | 'announced' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
  estimatedDate?: string;
  dependencies: string[]; // IDs of prerequisite technologies
  impact: string; // Description of its role in AGI
}
```

## Implementation Plan
1. Create component structure
2. Implement data model
3. Design visual layout
4. Add interactivity
5. Integrate with home page
6. Add animations and transitions
7. Test and refine

## Success Criteria
- Component successfully integrated into home page
- Clear visualization of the path to AGI
- Easy to understand technology relationships
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible to all users

## Dependencies
- Svelte
- Existing component library
- Timeline data structure
- Icon library for technology categories

## Notes
- Consider using a directed graph visualization for technology relationships
- May need to add new icons or visual elements
- Should be easily updatable as new technologies are announced
