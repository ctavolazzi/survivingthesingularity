      "description": "Humans have developed several ways to interface multiple conscious and unconscious minds together. Recently scientists developed a way for one \"sender\" to transmit motor signals to one \"receiver\" and other scientists discovered a manner of transmitting information through lucid dreams.\n\nNeuralink and similar devices are expected to provide significant gains in many fields such as neuroscience. However, significant ethical concerns as well as concerns surrounding inequality need careful discussion and consideration by the public and policy makers.\n\nLightweight Augmented Reality devices are being made with many years of AI-enhanced producitivity gains expected in the hardware and software of devices like Meta's smart glasses and other, similar headwear devices.\n\nMany of these devices use technology that has been patented and approved to receive brain wave data during use. The opportunities for scientific understanding, personal privacy invasion, and the creation of entierely unpredictable social disparities cannot be overstated.",
